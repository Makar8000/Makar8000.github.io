Loss or victory in these competitive matches affects participants' risers and tiers. Thus, when playing a ranked match, you will be matched with players of similar tier and riser to your own.

Custom matches allow participants to customize their group, arena, and other match settings. Members may be recruited via the Party Finder. The results of a custom match will not be reflected on Player PvP profiles, count toward achievements, or affect risers or tiers.

When you win a ranked match, you will gain one Rising Star. Similarly, a loss will remove one Star. Once you have earned the maximum three Rising Stars in one riser, an additional win will allow you to move up a riser. Winning three or more matches in a row while in the Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Diamond tier will apply a streak bonus, netting you two Rising Stars per win.

Once you have reached Crystal, the highest tier, victory and defeat will be reflected by your Crystal Credit, rather than Rising Stars. The amount of Credit you earn or forfeit in matches is determined by the difference in average Credit between your team and the opposing team. Streak bonuses do not apply to Crystal Credit.

To win, one team must move the tactical crystal from the center of the field to the goal point. If neither team accomplishes this during the time limit, victory will be awarded to the team with greatest progress. “Progress,” displayed on the HUD throughout the match, indicates the maximum progress a team has made in bringing the tactical crystal toward their goal at any point during the match─as opposed to its current position relative to either goal─and thus will never decrease even should the crystal be reclaimed by the opposing team.

If neither team reaches the goal by the time limit, and progress for both teams is tied or the team with lower progress score is currently within the ring around the tactical crystal, the match will proceed into overtime.

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>105.4</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>Glamour Plates</td><td></td><td>Created using the glamour dressers found inside inn rooms, glamour plates are a means of projecting an entire ensemble onto your gear. When designing a glamour plate, the equipment you wish to project must be stored inside a glamour dresser or armoire.

Ensembles saved to a glamour plate are applied with a single command, and can be projected over and over again without consuming glamour prisms. You can also use the gear set subcommand to link to plates, and instantly don your saved appearance by switching to the linked set.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>105.5</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>Dyeing Equipment</td><td></td><td>You can change the coloring of various gear and furnishing items through the use of &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;dyes&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;, with one pot of dye being consumed for each distinct section of an item.

Should you wish to restore gear to its original hue, a pot of terebinth removes the dye from a single item.

Both dyes and terebinth are available from vendors and the market boards, and can also be crafted by Disciples of the Hand from level 30 onwards.

Please note that not every piece of equipment is a candidate for dyeing. Items you can dye are marked with the corresponding symbol in the top right corner of their icons.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td></tr>
