<tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>TEXT_CHRHDY201_04725_SEQ_01</td><td>Godbert is ready to proceed with the refinement of his family's weaponry, and to that end, the goldsmith informs you that yet another type of meteoritic material is needed to enhance your armament's aetherial conductivity. According to his ancestor's manual, however, the true key to the process is something rather more intangible: a clarity achieved in the aftermath of an invigorating victory. Godbert claims to have already gained such battle-based enlightenment through his encounter with Doctor Lugae, and insists that Gerolt undergo his own form of martial meditation. You are to accompany the blacksmith to Windweft, where Godbert has prepared for him the perfect opponent.

When the hammering stops, however, you find yourself in possession of a successfully augmented Manderville masterpiece. Gerolt then inquires as to how long the entire refinement process is likely to take─a question to which Godbert has no present answer. In breaking the cipher, Godbert has realized that the manual is but the first part of an incomplete set, and that locating the remainder of Godbrand's instructions will be a quest unto itself. Until the continuation of the guide is found, you must content yourself with your as-yet-imperfect weaponry.</td></tr>
