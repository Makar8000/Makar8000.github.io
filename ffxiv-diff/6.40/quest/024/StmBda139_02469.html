Moved by the gesture, her steely demeanor softens, and you sense that the rift between the two may have finally begun to heal. Alas, there is no time for further conversation, as Carvallain declares that it is time to depart.

The voyage is smooth and almost entirely uneventful... &lt;Emphasis&gt;Almost.&lt;/Emphasis&gt; On a day like any other, while conversing with your comrades and the captain below deck, the ship lurches violently. Moments later a deckhand barges into the room, speaking of strange things in the water, and a mysterious force dragging the &lt;Emphasis&gt;Misery&lt;/Emphasis&gt; off course. With a sigh, Carvallain goes to investigate─but not before asking you to join him.</td></tr>

Carvallain duly agrees, and the matter is settled.

Once you arrive at your unknown destination, most will stay with the ship, but you and the fellow adventurers that you had the wisdom and foresight to invite to accompany you on this long journey to the Far East will proceed ashore and seek out the fiend responsible for your troubles.
