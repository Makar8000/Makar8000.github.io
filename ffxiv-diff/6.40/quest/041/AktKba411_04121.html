Knowing she plans to demonstrate her powers at a nearby tavern, you and Yugiri go to bear witness firsthand.

To Yugiri's surprise, Kisei's display is quite compelling. After a young man finishes conversing with what all believe is his departed father, others raise their voices in desperation, begging to speak with their loved ones.
