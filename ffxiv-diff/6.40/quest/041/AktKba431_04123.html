To appease the spirits of the deceased, she insists Hien render up the former conscripts as an offering to the kami Izanami. Hien summarily refuses, decrying the notion of sacrificing innocent lives. Though her followers' resolve begins to waver, Kisei will not be denied, but before she can press the issue, the long-absent Gosetsu reveals himself. Lord Hien's faithful retainer comes bearing a letter for Akitsu from his father─a man once taken by Garlemald and still very much alive, despite Kisei's earlier display of channeling his spirit. This revelation calls the truth of the priestess's powers into question, prompting her to leave in shame, but not before vowing revenge at the hands of her stepdaughter.

The stunned and embarrassed villagers disperse, and soon after Tonbo steps forward to apologize to Hien. The youth goes on to voice his fear that he may one day succumb to despair and become a monster as his brother did, and with the villagers now disillusioned with Kisei, others may follow. Indeed, the people of Doma are yet burdened by loss and grief with which they have yet to come to terms. Hien recognizes this, and, with Gosetsu's counsel, hopes to find a means to provide them with a measure of comfort, that they may begin to heal.

※The next role quest will be available from Yugiri upon reaching level 89 in any physical ranged DPS class.→Not long after you arrive at the Doman Enclave, Kisei appears with a number of villagers in tow.
