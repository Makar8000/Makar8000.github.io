<tr><td></td><td>6</td><td>TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_06</td><td>After a flurry of activity, Ronitt's latest creation is completed. He has incorporated his existing automaton technology into a mechanized factory, which he claims will increase the speed at which the remaining tanks may be produced. While this does raise the question of how exactly this was a more effective use of time and resources than simply repeating the steps used to create the prototype, it seems the general consensus is to go along with Ronitt's schemes, regardless of how absurd they may be.

The newly constructed automated factory whirs into life and the tanks approach completion. However, the day of reckoning has arrived, and it appears that Ronitt's efforts may have been too little, too late. Ozogg believes there is no other option but to delay the arrival of Chief Xamott to allow Ronitt time to finish his work before final judgment can be passed.</td></tr>
