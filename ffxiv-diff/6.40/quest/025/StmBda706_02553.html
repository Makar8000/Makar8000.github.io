You regard him silently as he proceeds to mock his great-grandfather's legacy, while hinting at his own dark ambitions, biding your time to strike. At last, he declares that all he has done, he did but for the joy of doing it, and that only man has the wisdom and the clarity to embrace violence for its own sake...as you have.

His manifesto thus delivered, Zenos frees Shinryu from its restraints and cries out defiantly as it bathes you both in dragon fire. Unscathed, your foe rises into the air and uses his power as a Resonant to merge with the primal, binding it to his will. As he towers over you, transformed, he glimpses Ilberd's final moments, and declares this to be “an ending to mark a new beginning,” before taking to the air. Nor is he mistaken. For if you and your comrades─those stalwart yet humble adventurers who have stood by you from first to last─do not stop Zenos yae Galvus...no one will.
