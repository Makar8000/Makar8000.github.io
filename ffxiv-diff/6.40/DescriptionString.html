Speak with Dryskthota at the ferry docks to register as a crew member and board the &lt;Emphasis&gt;Endeavor&lt;/Emphasis&gt;.

Once you have earned the maximum three Rising Stars in one riser, an additional win will allow you to move up a riser. Winning three or more matches in a row while in the Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Diamond tier will apply a streak bonus, netting you two Rising Stars per win.

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>941</td><td>Casting Glamours</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>942</td><td>Glamours are a means of projecting the appearance of one piece of equipment onto another. This can be accomplished with the subcommand on the item you wish to alter, or by using Cast Glamour from Actions &amp; Traits.

Casting glamours requires catalysts known as &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;glamour prisms&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;, with one prism being consumed per cast. Among other sources, glamour prisms can be obtained from the market board or from Grand Company quartermasters.

The presence of a glamour is indicated by a symbol in the upper right corner of the item icon. Removing glamours requires the use of &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;glamour dispellers&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;, which are also available from market boards or certain vendors.

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>944</td><td>Created using the glamour dressers found inside inn rooms, glamour plates are a means of projecting an entire ensemble onto your gear. When designing a glamour plate, the equipment you wish to project must be stored inside a glamour dresser or armoire.

Ensembles saved to a glamour plate are applied with a single command, and can be projected over and over again without consuming glamour prisms. You can also use the gear set subcommand to link to plates, and instantly don your saved appearance by switching to the linked set.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>946</td><td>Glamour dressers are available in every inn room, and can be used to store equipment as glamours. Any type of gear can be stored free of charge, up to the dresser's maximum capacity.

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>948</td><td>Available in inn rooms or placed as furnishings in player estates, armoires are used to store artifact armor, seasonal event costumes, achievement rewards, bonus items, and other specific gear.

An unlimited amount of equipment can be stored in the armoire at no cost, but please note that any dyes, crests, or glamours will be removed. Additionally, spiritbond will be reset to 0% and durability will be set to 100%.

If you wish to keep dyes when storing items, or wish to use dyed items to cast glamours, the glamour dresser is the more suitable choice.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>949</td><td>Dyeing Equipment</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>950</td><td>You can change the coloring of various gear and furnishing items through the use of &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;dyes&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;, with one pot of dye being consumed for each distinct section of an item.

Should you wish to restore gear to its original hue, a pot of terebinth removes the dye from a single item.

Both dyes and terebinth are available from vendors and the market boards, and can also be crafted by Disciples of the Hand from level 30 onwards.

Please note that not every piece of equipment is a candidate for dyeing. Items you can dye are marked with the corresponding symbol in the top right corner of their icons.</td></tr>
