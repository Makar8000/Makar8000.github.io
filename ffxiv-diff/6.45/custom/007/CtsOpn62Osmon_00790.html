<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>25</td><td>TEXT_CTSOPN62OSMON_00790_OSMON_000_022</td><td class="modify">→In the past, the guildship would often assign gleaners to Kugane, that we might locate and collect valuable Far Eastern antiques. Yet our every attempt to purchase these items ended in failure, for an unknown buyer outbid us at every turn.</td></tr>

To my knowledge, Shallow Moor has not had the displeasure of bidding against the man... Perhaps that is best.</td></tr>

A shame indeed that the whole mountain had to suffer for one man's avarice.</td></tr>
