Gogo himself arrives and bows to your skill, but Nutiba is concerned at how Kageyama will react. As if on cue, the Kugane merchant appears on the scene in a state of denial, refusing to accept the reality of the defeat. Royse, unconcerned by this development, then springs her trap, which sees Kageyama apprehended by the Brass Blades on charges of smuggling.

His fiancée freed from the threat of violence, a relieved Nutiba at last feels safe enough to close down the Fukumen Fighting Festival. Gogo, however, suddenly begs Royse to reconsider, and allow their arena to continue as a joint venture under her management. Royse agrees to the request, and thus the Far Eastern chapters of the Masked Carnivale and the Blue Mages' Guild are made official. With matters brought to a satisfactory conclusion, your friends and former foes go their separate ways, leaving you behind with a whimsical-minded guildmaster.</td></tr>
