Shockmaw is spoken of in hushed whispers, but on the island of Aloalo a creature named “Ketuduke” was an object of reverence. Believed to be a divine messenger, Ketuduke would descend from the skies on a night when the winds howled and waters raged. The faithful would then climb atop its back and be delivered to paradise.</td></tr>

Perhaps due to a sense of kinship with other lost things, she makes ingenious use of items collected from shipwrecks and other detritus that washes ashore.</td></tr>

She is greatly revered in Gridania, and the deity's more warlike incarnation famously graces a recruitment poster for the Order of the Twin Adder. Although mythological tales put her at odds with Halone, the Fury, the two seemed to bear each other no ill will in Euphrosyne.</td></tr>
