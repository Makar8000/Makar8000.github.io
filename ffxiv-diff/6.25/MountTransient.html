There is no greater pleasure for it than to connect with others in the microcosm of its heart. Literally.</td><td class="modify">→Just like jellyfish, they jump, jerk,

Able to comprehend language, it loved nothing more than to listen to Khloe Aliapoh's tales, whose heroic protagonist it aspired to bear upon its back─in contest with another of Rowena's pets.</td><td>I doubt even my falcons
could keep pace with it.

From the creature itself to the presents, all is recreated in such impressive detail that it could only be considered a Starlight miracle.</td><td>It's a Starlight miracle!

It moves in response to its master's will, but whether it does so via the spirits of Sil'dihns long dead or simple magicks is unknown.</td><td class="modify">→H-How could you mistake me for
that overstuffed throne-warmer!?

Contrary to its appearance, the pom on the tail is the actual being rather than the mouselike creature.</td><td class="modify">→I'm countin' on ye to
clean up this mess.
