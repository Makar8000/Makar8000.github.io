<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>868</td><td class="modify">→An extensive warren of tunnels and waterways stretches beneath the barren lands of Thanalan, but none come now to marvel at this remnant of fallen Sil'dih. Its memories lie undisturbed, festering silently in the dark and the damp. Yet not for much longer. You have come at the personal behest of Nanamo Ul Namo, and together will you throw open the gate to the desert nation's troubled past.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>869</td><td>Owing to the ingenuity of Hannish alchemists, you have succeeded in expanding the voidgate in the treasure vault, and prepare to set forth on your mission to find Vrtra's brood-sister Azdaja in the Thirteenth. Beyond the emptiness of the rift awaits a shadowed castle swarming with voidsent, and you steel yourselves for a hostile reception.</td></tr>
<tr class="gap"><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>877</td><td>The story of Agdistis and her demise is the stuff of legends, and Nemjiji frantically makes notes in the margins of her records as you recount your tale. However, her scrawling makes it difficult to tell whether these are embellishments or scientific musings. Either way, ere your quest is through, parchment and ink may very well become a precious resource in Claudien's workshop.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>878</td><td class="modify">→The retelling of your adventures has set Osmon's imagination aflame with visions of perilous passages and mighty sentinels. He wonders, however, if dwelling in the damp has weakened the guardians; if, before rust and decay set in, that they had once been far more powerful. You cannot help but ponder the possibilities, your thoughts drifting as Osmon's hypothetical scenario plays out in your mind...  </td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>879</td><td class="modify">→Building on the details of your expedition into the Sil'dihn Subterrane, Osmon has put quill to parchment and produced his ideal adventure novel. The pages fairly drip with evocative descriptions and breathtaking action, the epic dramatization putting you in mind of a certain wandering minstrel's compositions. And in similar fashion, you are drawn into a world that never was, yet feels so inexplicably real...</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>880</td><td>Lahabrea insists that the only way to save the star from the horrors lurking within Pandæmonium is summary destruction. However, Themis and Erichthonios succeed in convincing the chief keyward to allow you a chance to prove the worth of another way. You are tasked with interring Hegemone, the keyward of Abyssos and a master of creation magicks in her own right. Succeed in this, and you may continue your journey into the facility's deeper circles. Fail, and Pandæmonium─along with its warders and creations─shall be reduced to nothing.</td></tr>
