This year's vision, she admits, was rather unusual in that it prominently featured tonberries, creatures of myth known less for their seasonal whimsy than their habit of mercilessly stabbing things. This peculiarity is but the first of two complications facing the festivities this year─a group of sylphs is currently dismantling decorations, harrassing residents, and otherwise making a nuisance of themselves in Gridania. For an irony, the first oddity will serve to ameliorate the second, or so claims Jihli's eager new volunteer, Hamlyn. As a self-proclaimed tonberry connoisseur, Hamlyn assures you that approaching the sylphs disguised as such a terrifying (yet adorable?) creature will be sure to drive them off, and it just so happens he has a tonberry costume in your size...

She admits that this year's vision was rather peculiar because it featured tonberries, creatures of myth known less for their seasonal whimsy and more for their habit of mercilessly stabbing things. This dream proved prophetic indeed, when sylphs descended upon Gridania, dismantling decorations, harassing residents, and otherwise making a nuisance of themselves. These mischievous creatures are deathly afraid of the tonberries' wilting (yet adorable?) gaze, and with the help of a self-proclaimed tonberry connoisseur named Hamlyn, Jihli Aliapoh's volunteers have donned tonberry costumes to scare off the sylphs. They are shorthanded, however, and Hamlyn just so happens to have a costume in your size...
