<tr><td></td><td>284</td><td>Summon forth your pod 602 mount. May leave you hanging, but will never let you go. Unless it malfunctions, or runs out of energy, or...you get the idea.</td><td>Recovered from the ruins of the machine lifeforms, this diminutive white machina was created to provide YoRHa units with movement support. On account of this, it can easily transport one person...if not exactly in style or comfort.</td><td>Those who are ready and
willing to fight will never
want for transportation!

Guaranteed to instill a sense of well-being within all those in earshot.</td><td class="modify">→This enhanced version of the supporter was lovingly created by the ever-innovative Inventingway. Not satisfied with merely making it ridable, the Loporrit also fitted a compact speaker that can belt out Dreamingway's feel-good sounds.</td><td class="modify">→Well, then, let's hop to it!

<tr><td></td><td>286</td><td>Summon forth your island alligator. Demands to be seen not later, but always.</td><td>Hailing from unknown shores, this alligator appeared on your island one day and made itself at home. It takes pride in the fact that its kind is rare out at sea, and willingly carries a rider upon its back if only so it can parade itself in front of all and sundry.</td><td>A face you could kiss─if
it weren't covered in scales,
that is!

<tr><td></td><td>291</td><td>Summon forth your vinegaroon mount, a carnivorous scalekin with a jaw reminiscent of claws.</td><td>While it is common for dragons to use vinegaroons as servants, men have struggled to domesticate the creatures. In recent years, however, the gleaners have developed a successful training method, allowing them to be employed as beasts of burden.</td><td>Those vinegaroons are always chasing
after us moogles, snapping their bladed
jaws and swinging their bladed tails.

Though that experiment ended in failure, by way of a peculiar side effect, it has attained the power of flight.</td><td class="modify">→What you after? Fish? Crab?

<tr><td></td><td>293</td><td>Summon forth your bluefeather lynx mount, which could be what a certain feathered familiar might look like as a large, winged feline.</td><td>A phantom creation composed of the esoteric power of dynamis. It is believed that the Endsinger brought forth this mysterious entity, but for what purpose is unclear. Could it be a tribute, perhaps, bestowed upon one who has overcome her aria of despair?</td><td>The light of hope shall ever
guide our steps so long as we

As its name, meaning “eternal,” would suggest, it possesses remarkable vitality, and in addition to serving as an armored warbeast, it was also a subject in the Allagans' research into immortality.</td><td class="modify">→Eternal life can be yours,
