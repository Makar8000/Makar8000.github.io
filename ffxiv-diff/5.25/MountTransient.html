The strong and silent type, so don't expect rousing conversation.</td><td>Alerted to its presence in the basement of Eulmore, the hunters of Clan Nutsy set out to vanquish this sin eater. Upon seeing that the creature was not aggressive, however, they decided to keep it instead.</td><td>Pray excuse our reticence.
