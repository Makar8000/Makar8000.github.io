Though its kind are ferocious by nature, for reasons unknown, this particular specimen treats you as an old friend...and here we are.</td><td class="modify">→Shark! Shark! Run for your lives!

these snowmen, yes, but...I can't
quite put my finger on it.

In the past, the species was so aggressive that it was known to actively hunt animals for sustenance, but the Doppro people have succeeded in their domestication.</td><td class="modify">→Truly, a more effective deterrent
