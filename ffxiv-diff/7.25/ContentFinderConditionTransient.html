<tr><td></td><td>1017</td><td>With harp cradled in his arms, the wandering minstrel sings a sorrowful song of a recreated queen. Helpless to defy the purpose she was given, this simulacrum sought to preserve the memories of her subjects by taking the lives of innocents in other reflections. Though she met her end by your hands, had she been further along her ill-fated path by the time of your confrontation, might she have proven unstoppable and gone on to wreak untold death and devastation? Such questions play on your mind as the minstrel's verse bears you away to a world of the imagination, where you once again come face-to-face with the dread entity known as Queen Eternal...</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>1018</td><td class="modify">→Even the most dauntless of sailors would sooner abandon ship than steer into Shades' Triangle. Fooled by the lush and fertile island shimmering on the horizon─men and vessels alike have been lost to its allure, never to be seen again. Yet this fearsome reputation has done little to quell Ketenramm's appetite for adventure. Having joined his intrepid crew, you venture forth unto the high seas, only to be confounded by a shifting mirage. Amidst the confusion, a strange voice beckons you onward as the vessel is inexorably drawn towards the crescent-shaped isle. What secrets await upon its southern shores?</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>1019</td><td>The first opponent of your cruiserweight campaign is to be the shameless playboy of Solution Nine, Dancing Green. Wielding the soul of a terrible toad, he prefers to engage his opponents in duels of dance, using his heightened abilities to command the dance floor. If you are to claim victory, you shall need more than might and magic─indeed, you shall need a sense of rhythm.</td></tr>
