Players can enter the Bozjan southern front solo or in a party. It is possible to form a party even after entering the instance.

■Requirements
A Disciple of War or Magic level 71 or higher is required to enter.

■Restrictions
Once inside, you are free to change to any Disciple of War or Magic that meets the requirements to enter. However, you cannot change jobs while participating in a critical engagement.

All forays in the Bozjan southern front are level synced, with character levels adjusted to 80, and all equipment adjusted to item level 430. Furthermore, materia bonuses will be ignored, regardless of the item level of gear affixed with materia. Any experience points gained will apply to your job level prior to level sync.</td><td></td><td>...</td></tr>

Players who contribute to the initiation of a critical engagement may receive priority when registering for their next deployment. It should be noted that those with combatant's priority deployment are more likely to be chosen.

Lost actions are special abilities that can only be used in the Bozjan southern front. To acquire these actions, players must first find forgotten fragments, which drop occasionally when participating in skirmishes and critical engagements. These fragments can examined by a Resistance appraiser, transforming them into lost actions.
There are a variety of lost actions to be found, some requiring a certain Resistance rank before they can be used. Any lost actions you have obtained will be automatically stored in the lost finds cache.

■Uses and Restrictions
There are six types of lost actions: offensive, defensive, restorative, beneficial, tactical, and detrimental. In certain cases, they may also be used as items rather than traditional actions.
It should be noted, however, that no one job can master them all, as each action has specific job requirements to use them.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>...</td></tr>
