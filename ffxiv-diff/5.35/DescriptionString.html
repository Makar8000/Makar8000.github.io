<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>394</td><td class="modify">→■Basic Rules
Players can enter the Bozjan southern front solo or in a party. It is possible to form a party even after entering the instance.

■Requirements
A Disciple of War or Magic level 71 or higher is required to enter.

■Restrictions
Once inside, you are free to change to any Disciple of War or Magic that meets the requirements to enter. However, you cannot change jobs while participating in a critical engagement.

All forays in the Bozjan southern front are level synced, with character levels adjusted to 80, and all equipment adjusted to item level 430. Furthermore, materia bonuses will be ignored, regardless of the item level of gear affixed with materia. Any experience points gained will apply to your job level prior to level sync.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>395</td><td class="modify">→Your reputation in the Bozjan southern front is represented by your &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201F4&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201F5&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Resistance rank&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;.

To increase your Resistance rank, you can participate in skirmishes and critical engagements to earn &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201F4&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201F5&lt;/UIGlow&gt;mettle&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;. After earning sufficient mettle, speak with the Resistance commander at Utya's Aegis to be promoted. As you increase in rank, the Resistance's front line will advance, allowing you to explore new areas in the southern front, as well as increase the capacity of the lost finds cache.

Your rank and mettle earned will be retained between visits─progress will not be lost when you depart the Bozjan southern front.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>396</td><td class="modify">→Falling in battle in the southern front will incur a penalty.

■Incapacitation Penalty
A portion of the mettle required to reach your next rank will be lost upon incapacitation.

■Return Penalty
After being incapacitated, using Return to retreat from the battlefield to Utya's Aegis will incur an additional penalty of lost mettle. This penalty can also be incurred by leaving the instance while incapacitated.

The amount of mettle lost is dependent on your Resistance rank. It is worth noting, however, your rank cannot go down as a result of losing mettle. Furthermore, no penalty will be incurred below Resistance rank 5.</td></tr>

<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>400</td><td class="modify">→It is possible to gain priority deployment for critical engagements. This can be accomplished in one of two ways.

■Quartermaster's Priority Deployment
Players may receive priority deployment in exchange for Bozjan clusters by speaking to the Resistance quartermaster at Utya's Aegis.

■Combatant's Priority Deployment
Players who contribute to the initiation of a critical engagement may receive priority when registering for their next deployment. It should be noted that those with combatant's priority deployment are more likely to be chosen.

When registering as a party, all party members must have the same type of priority deployment for it to be recognized.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>401</td><td class="modify">→When defeating warmachina, there is a chance players will come across Bozjan clusters.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>402</td><td class="modify">→These crystals can be traded to the Resistance quartermaster at Utya's Aegis for various goods and services.

■Critical Engagement Priority Deployment
Bozjan clusters can be used to gain priority deployment for critical engagements.

■Item Exchange
Bozjan clusters can also be used to exchange for various items, including forgotten fragments.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>403</td><td class="modify">→■Overview
Lost actions are special abilities that can only be used in the Bozjan southern front. To acquire these actions, players must first find forgotten fragments, which drop occasionally when participating in skirmishes and critical engagements. These fragments can examined by a Resistance appraiser, transforming them into lost actions.
There are a variety of lost actions to be found, some requiring a certain Resistance rank before they can be used. Any lost actions you have obtained will be automatically stored in the lost finds cache.

■Uses and Restrictions
There are six types of lost actions: offensive, defensive, restorative, beneficial, tactical, and detrimental. In certain cases, they may also be used as items rather than traditional actions.
It should be noted, however, that no one job can master them all, as each action has specific job requirements to use them.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>404</td><td class="modify">→Any lost actions not currently in use can be found in the lost finds cache. The cache can hold up to 200 of any given lost action. Those that exceed this limit will be lost.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>405</td><td class="modify">→To use lost actions in battle, they must first be moved from the lost finds cache to the lost finds holster. You must choose carefully, as the holster can only hold a limited number of actions. However, this limit can be increased with a higher Resistance rank.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>406</td><td class="modify">→■Removing and Storing Lost Actions
Lost actions can be moved freely between the lost finds cache and lost finds holster. Be mindful, however, that the lost finds holster has a limited capacity for actions.

■Action Sets
Up to 10 combinations of your favorite lost actions can be saved as sets.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>407</td><td class="modify">→While assisting the Bozjan resistance in their fight against the Empire, you will have the opportunity to create Bozjan gear.

<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>409</td><td class="modify">→Before lost actions can be used, they must first be converted into duty actions. Once converted, they will remain as duty actions even after leaving the instance, and will only expire after all uses have been depleted.

Lost actions from the item category, however, are unique in that they may be used directly from the lost finds holster. They may also be assigned to your hotbar, making them ideal for use in emergencies.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>410</td><td class="modify">→■Keyboard and Mouse
All duty actions and items can be used by left-clicking their icon, but can be bound to other keys.

■Gamepad
Duty actions are used by pressing &lt;CommandIcon(17)/&gt; while holding down both &lt;CommandIcon(14)/&gt; and &lt;CommandIcon(15)/&gt;. Lost actions from the item category must be selected from the lost finds holster. They may also be assigned to your hotbar.</td></tr>
