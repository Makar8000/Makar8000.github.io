<tr><td></td><td>4</td><td>TEXT_CHRHDB852_04800_SEQ_04</td><td>After witnessing the fall of his primal champion, Vanhudi attempts to flee, only to be foiled when his airship is shot down by a familiar-looking alien starship. This vessel belongs to PuPu's missing friend, who had been deceived by the avaricious merchant─and as a result determined that the people of Etheirys cannot be trusted. The alien thus declares his intention to subjugate the world, beginning with Hildibrand and company.

PuPu uses his own starship to fend off the rampaging extraterrestrial, and the counterattack unintentionally breaches his opponent's reactor core. Realizing that the craft is primed for a violent explosion, Brandihild manipulates the ship's external controls to fly it high into the air before it detonates in spectacular fashion. In light of Brandihild's heroics, PuPu's comrade has a change of heart, becoming convinced that peaceful coexistence on Etheirys is possible after all.

Hildibrand assures everyone that his hardy clone will be just fine, then turns his attention to PuPu's damaged starship...which promptly malfunctions, abducts the frantic inspector, then takes off into the distance at a ludicrous rate of speed. Unperturbed by this typical turn of events and content to leave Vanhudi to the mercy of the Radiant Host, Godbert suggests a return to Radz–at–Han.</td></tr>
