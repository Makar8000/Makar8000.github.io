Even though double the handicrafts will be created under an efficiency bonus, no additional materials are required.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Furthermore, efficiency bonuses may be chained.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

Using efficiency bonuses strategically can vastly increase your workshop's earnings.

■Limitations
Efficiency bonuses will not be applied to the same item created in sequence. Additionally, efficiency bonuses are only applicable within a given cycle, and will not carry over to the following cycle.

■Groove
When efficiency bonuses are triggered, your mammets' happy production groove will intensify. High groove scores will apply a further bonus to profits when handicrafts are shipped.

Groove is reset at the beginning of each season. Maximum groove attainable will also increase with the number of landmarks constructed on your island.</td><td></td><td>...</td></tr>

The more popular an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Popularity may change at the beginning of a new season, but it will remain constant throughout that season.

・Supply
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Items will be in one of the following fives stages of supply: Nonexistent, Insufficient, Sufficient, Surplus, and Overflowing.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

The less abundant an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Furthermore, the popularity of handicrafts may change each cycle according to both commercial trends in Limsa Lominsa and the type/amount of items you sell from your island.

You can check predicted shifts in market behavior by referencing the “Demand Shift” column of the Supply &amp; Demand interface.

If you produce too much of the same product, the market will be inundated with it, causing supply to become “Overflowing.” Pay special attention to changes in the market when looking to create a large amount of a single kind of handicraft.→・Popularity
