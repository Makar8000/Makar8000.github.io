Making light of his failure, he declares that while the day may be yours, your efforts have earned you no more than a brief stay of execution, and with that he takes his leave. Whether the Ascian is right only time will tell, but the fact remains that when tested, the Grand Company of Eorzea emerged unbroken, which is surely cause to celebrate in itself. You permit yourself a weary smile, and troop from the field. Soon after, a grateful Lord Aymeric offers to fly you and your comrades back to the Rising Stones─where it becomes clear he has much to discuss.</td></tr>

Given Sharlayan's preeminence in the field of aetherological research, it is agreed that the solution will most likely be found there; along, perhaps, with knowledge pertaining to the Final Days. Unfortunately, you will not be able to confirm your suspicions until Krile has obtained permission for you all to set foot in the infamously insular nation, and a long wait seems in prospect.

Sometime later, you accompany Y'shtola and the others on an expedition to investigate the mechanism by which the towers absorb aether, and learn to your dismay that they are draining the lifeblood of the land itself. As you grimly turn for home, you hear an ephemeral voice call out to you and you alone...

It warns that the end draws nigh...and that the fate of the star is in your hands.
