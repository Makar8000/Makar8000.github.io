<tr><td></td><td>3</td><td>TEXT_JOBDRK600_02064_SEQ_03</td><td>Desperate to find absolution in the death of her daughter, Countess Ystride quickly discards all pretense and commands wave after wave of Temple Knights to kill Rielle. Eventually, she attempts to carry out the deed herself, but you and Sidurgu manage to subdue her and kill her remaining knights. The dark knight stands poised to strike her down as well, but relents, reasoning that for all her crimes, she is still Rielle's mother. However, the countess declares that she will never stop hunting the girl, for it is the will of the Fury.

Perhaps, in some corner of her heart, she knew it could only end like this. Rielle steps forward and tells Ystride that she will pray for her one last time, that she might find peace in Halone's halls. Grudgingly, Sidurgu readies his sword once more, and Rielle begins to administer the last rites to her mother. As the blade meets her neck, Ystride looks to her daughter, and for a moment, the hatred which consumed her is nowhere to be seen... After a time, Rielle says simply that you will return to Ishgard. Sparing a final glance for her mother, she turns and walks away.</td></tr>
