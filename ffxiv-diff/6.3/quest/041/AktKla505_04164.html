It is at this point that Kytte arrives to report a similar incident, wherein a veritable legion of fish has washed ashore in Yedlihmad not far from the experimental aetheryte. The coincidence is too great to ignore. Plucking up his courage, T'laqa Tia volunteers himself to join you in Yedlihmad, where you might begin investigating this worrisome occurrence.</td></tr>

As suspected, it contained the same levels of aether as the wayward whale, and, after a brief discussion, you agree that the tidal bore─and thus some property of the moon─is likely the culprit of this strange behavior. T'laqa Tia theorizes that Zodiark's demise and the sudden release of massive amounts of aether could account for the discrepancies, but obtaining an uncontaminated species for comparison is an endeavor that will require more careful consideration...</td></tr>
