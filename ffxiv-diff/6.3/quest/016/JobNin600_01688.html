However, the captain goes back on her word when Princess Yuki brings them, and orders her bound and stowed with the other prisoners. Just as all hope seems lost, you appear with Akagi. Princess Yuki finally commands you to rescue her. You draw your daggers, slash Oboro's bonds, and take the fight to Redway. When the sellsword realizes he is losing, he makes to run─only to meet a gory end on Rosalinde's axe blade. After the battle continues, you finally put an end to the cutthroat captain's reaving for good. Their leader dead, the remaining Truehounds run, leaving behind all the treasures of the Yatsurugi clan. Princess Yuki offers her heartfelt thanks, and then turns excitedly to her freed vassals. With the profits from these treasures, her lands can be rebuilt. Oboro indicates it is time to take your leave. Speak with him in the dock storehouse.</td></tr>
