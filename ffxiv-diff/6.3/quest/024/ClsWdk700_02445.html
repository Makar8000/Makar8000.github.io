For such a tea party to take place, however, certain Kugane-style furnishings must first be made. As one of the two carpenters to have experienced firsthand the wonders of the teahouses in the Far East, it is up to you to craft them. Fashion a high-quality teahouse bench and present it to Gairhard.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Beatin.</td></tr>

While her furnishings are still lacking in quality, he points out that the customer's satisfaction is the most important thing, and encourages her to continue dedicating herself to her craft.
