<tr><td></td><td>3</td><td>TEXT_JOBNIN700_02952_SEQ_03</td><td>Karasu offers some rare words of praise for your skill at ninjutsu before walking off to wherever the wind will carry him. No sooner has he left than you are joined by Oboro and the rest of your companions, who joyfully report their triumph over the Kagekakushi clan. Oboro rejoices at the return of the scroll to the village, but soon realizes that Karasu has made off with the true other half. Jacke claims the fake scroll and sets off for Limsa with proof that his job is done, and Princess Yuki─heartened to have repaid her debt to you and Oboro─likewise runs off to Eorzea in search of her hapless retainer Akagi. Oboro expresses his intent to go after Karasu, and asks Tsubame to concoct another tale to explain his absence to the village elders. After a round of farewells has been exchanged, Oboro bids you visit him at his hideout upon your return to Eorzea, where he would share with you a final word.</td></tr>

Though his mind thus far has often been clouded with doubts, his reflection on the story of Master Sasuke and the origins of his village has given him clarity. He would follow in the footsteps of his honorable forebear, walking the path he believes in even if it means setting aside his commitments to his homeland in favor of listening to his own heart. With a newfound sense of purpose, he resolves to pursue Karasu and the missing scroll. Thanking you one last time for your friendship and your commitment to the path of the shinobi, he bids you farewell for the day, expressing his wish that your next adventure together will come someday soon.
