While the merchant knows naught of the mysterious sack's contents, he informs you that it and its bearer are bound for the beaches of Saltwind's Welcome.

Moments later, he is joined by Doctor Lugae, an amalgamation of flesh and metal that you vaguely recall besting in the Tower of Babil. The doctor, who specializes in the creation of artificial life-forms, seeks the perfect physical specimen for use in his experiments─Hildibrand, apparently.

You and Nashu rush to your comrade's defense, prompting Lugae to attempt to flee with his prize, but a skillful toss of the spirit vessel serves to awaken the inspector. After an impressive display of agility, Hildibrand somehow finds himself atop Lugae's head, and subsequently triggers one of the doctor's shoulder-mounted missiles to launch. Straddling the projectile, the inspector is propelled beyond the heavens and briefly into the void beyond, before he begins his rapid descent. In a fit of desperation, Hildibrand mashes buttons on the missile itself, redirecting its course at the last instant into the fleeing Lugae's face.

When the ashes have settled, Lugae's head and Jubraca are taken into custody by the local authorities, while the miraculously not-dead Hildibrand dusts himself off and poses proudly atop the sands. His moment of triumph is short-lived, however, as a curious flying vessel not unlike the ones described by Delion descends from the heavens and entraps him with a beam of light before flying off to gods-know-where...→From the shadows at Saltwind's Welcome, you watch as your quarry removes a comatose Hildibrand from his sack and offers the body to Jubraca─a revelation that is not surprising in the least given the merchant's previous chicanery.
