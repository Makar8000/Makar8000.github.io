The medicines he once hoarded and sold for unreasonable profits will be sold to more merchants due to the intervention of Hannish officials, thereby ensuring lower prices and greater supply. All indebted to Akebono will be absolved of their debts, for they were secured through immoral means. This, in particular, Shigure considers to be the greater victory now, for his experiences with you and the others have helped him to understand that the world is anything but black and white. While he may not agree with the Wolf Burglar's methods, he understands that he is a noble soul─though should he ever forsake his principles, Shigure will not hesitate to bring him to justice. A necessary sentiment, perhaps, though if your experiences with the Lupin are any indication, he will keep to his chosen path.

And Inspector Hildibrand? Well, as a former inquisitor once mused, he will no doubt turn up again like a bad gil─and when he does, trouble is sure to follow...

※The next Hildibrand quest will be available from the excitable youth in Radz–at–Han once you have met the following requirements:
※ You must have registered a product key for FINAL FANTASY XIV: Endwalker to your service account.
※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “Endwalker.”→Much will change in the wake of Akebono's fall, Shigure explains.
