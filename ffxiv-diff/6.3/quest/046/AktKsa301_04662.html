As a condition, however, he has requested that you attend the negotiations in Kugane. Though his motivations are unclear─and probably suspect─you can only hope that this impromptu journey affords you the opportunity to procure another suitable treasure for the restoration of Tataru's necklace.</td></tr>

In a bid to salvage the operation, he seeks to feature the Far Eastern-styled wares of Tataru's boutique. A reasonable strategy, but one that did not require your involvement─which Hancock readily admits. Indeed, it seems he only invited you at the behest of another party, who has requested that you meet with them at Sakazuki in the Ruby Sea.</td></tr>

A merchant in Kugane is calling himself the descendant of Tenzen, and the auspices suspect he is using the name of their former companion to swindle unsuspecting folk. Though Suzaku and Seiryu would like nothing more than to slaughter the pretender for his misdeeds, Genbu believes you should first take his measure for yourselves, and to that end proposes that you all travel to Kugane. The auspices assure you that they can keep their identities hidden, but precisely how remains to be seen...</td></tr>

For the time being, they appear to prove sufficient, allowing you to search for Tenzen's “descendant” on Kogane Dori. It is there you find your quarry, wearing armor identical to that of Tenzen's, declaring his storied lineage to a crowd of onlookers. He proceeds to summon the “Four Lords” to further bolster his claims─three mummers and a cat─as the auspices look on with a mixture of disbelief and disgust. As he uses Tenzen's name to sell fake charms to the gathered people, it becomes plain that his scheme is to profit off Tenzen's good name, and that an intervention is warranted.</td></tr>

She indicates he departed in the direction of Tasogare Bridge, and so you and your conspicuous comrades journey there next.

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td class="add">8</td><td class="add">TEXT_AKTKSA301_04662_SEQ_08</td><td class="add">Seeing no sign of your quarry at Tasogare Bridge, you speak instead with an exasperated man who bore witness to the spectacle. Alas, he has no useful information to share, and so you prepare to search elsewhere─but in that moment of resignation, the incorrigible Gyodo waddles onto the scene. He tells you of the swindler's true identity─a seamster named Isshu─and of his dealings with Kageyama, the notorious soy sauce baron. Though Isshu is clearly guilty of deceiving others, Gyodo was surprised that the seamster embraced a life of crime, given his otherwise upstanding reputation. Nevertheless, the Namazu directs you to the Isle of Bekko, where the conspirators will soon be meeting in secret.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td class="add">9</td><td class="add">TEXT_AKTKSA301_04662_SEQ_09</td><td class="add">Hiding in the shadows, you and the two auspices eavesdrop on Isshu and Kageyama's conversation, and learn that Isshu, having lost his job, has been masquerading as Tenzen's descendant at the baron's behest. Realizing that the seamster was but a pawn in Kageyama's scheme, you confront the mastermind and demand he cease his villainy. Naturally, he refuses, and so aided by Soroban and Byakko's timely arrival, you and the Four Lords put the fear of the kami into his very soul. As you hold the Phoenix Blade aloft, the auspices reveal their true forms, and a thoroughly cowed Kageyama is convinced that you are Tenzen's rightful heir. He flees in terror, crying out for mercy and vowing never again to use Tenzen's name for ill.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td class="add">10</td><td class="add">TEXT_AKTKSA301_04662_SEQ_10</td><td class="add">A contrite Isshu intends to make amends by turning himself into the Sekiseigumi in the knowledge that he will surely be imprisoned for his crimes. Hancock, however, has other ideas; upon arriving with Tataru, he explains that he has already convinced the authorities that Isshu was as much a victim as his customers, thus ensuring he will suffer no punishment. Furthermore, he wishes to hire the seamster, as he is still in need of a replacement for the draper shop. With matters resolved, you are free to go your separate ways─but not before Tataru chides the Four Lords for not involving her in your adventure. And so you bid the auspices farewell...though you have no doubt you have not seen the last of them.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td class="add">11</td><td class="add">TEXT_AKTKSA301_04662_SEQ_11</td><td class="add">At the Ruby Bazaar, Isshu presents you with a parcel containing fine garments as an expression of his gratitude. Hancock coyly mentions a “little something” he included as well─no doubt the treasure you sought to procure for Tataru's necklace. Noting this exchange, Tataru questions the smirking merchant, who effortlessly deflects her suspicions with the truth: it is payment for helping him to forge a relationship with the auspices, to whom he hopes to sell anything and everything he can. Satisfied and annoyed in equal measure, she proceeds to tell you that the East Aldenard Trading Company and Tataru Taru's Boutique have agreed to form a partnership. Eager to get to work immediately, Tataru asks that you return to Old Sharlayan to inform Mehdjina of their joint venture. And indeed you will deliver the news─along with Hancock's token of his appreciation.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td class="add">12</td><td class="add">TEXT_AKTKSA301_04662_SEQ_12</td><td class="add">Though pleased by the boutique's new partnership, Mehdjina is more delighted to see what sort of item Hancock picked out for Tataru's necklace. While the stylish ensemble Isshu wove is striking, it is no match for the otherworldly beauty of the black pearl, an exceedingly rare gemstone harvested from blacklip oysters in the Ruby Sea. Its darker shade should serve as a contrast to the brilliant sapphire centerpiece, and thereby make it stand out even more. The gift is yet more evidence of Hancock's impressive wealth and resourcefulness, and a reminder that despite any personal misgivings, he is a valuable ally worth retaining. Mehdjina thanks you for your hard work, and bids you rest until your services are needed once more─which may well be sooner than you think.</td></tr>
