Seeking to learn more about the fan, Aldiytha took it upon herself to investigate its origins, but has since been forced to halt her investigation due to her frail constitution. To lighten her burden, the royal seneschal entreats you to go to her aid, to which you promptly agree. With relief in his voice, he directs you to the Gold Court in the Steps of Thal, where he believes she is resting on a bench.

Bringing you up to speed, she explains that the plan for this year's celebration came into fruition when she found an antique folding fan in her home, the Thorne manor. After some research, she discovered that a fan of identical design was once used by Princess Edvya more than three centuries ago, when the audacious princess used it to perform a dance. Aldiytha, charmed by the tale, informed the royal seneschal of her desire to replicate the storied fan and incorporate it into the festivities, and so the plan to distribute fans to festival-goers was born. It was at this juncture, however, that the artisan in charge of the reproduction revealed that the fan itself was one of recent make, and not in fact from the era of the Thorne Dynasty. Desperate for answers, and unable to turn to her father, Aldiytha instead arranged to meet with a historian and a reporter with knowledge on the subject. Unable to rise to the occasion, she bids you meet with them in her stead.</td></tr>

You learn that the fan not only belonged to Aldiytha's mother, but that such fans in particular have traditionally been used in the Little Ladies' Dance, a dance passed down from mother to daughter in the Thorne family for generations. Eager to deliver the news to Aldiytha, and simultaneously perplexed as to how she is unaware of her own family's legacy, you make for the Gold Court. </td></tr>

To learn more of her mother, Claudia Thorne, and the Little Ladies' Dance, she bids you speak with well-to-do individuals in the vicinity of the Sapphire Avenue Exchange and Eshtaime's Aesthetics.</td></tr>

Yet despite her frequent bouts of illness, she left her mark on these two individuals, such that they well remember their interactions with her. One noblewoman─who, in turn, reveals herself to be an old friend of Claudia's─reflects fondly on the time she learned the Little Ladies' Dance, and is inspired to teach it to Aldiytha when she learns of her predicament. Meanwhile, a restless nobleman conversely recalls a bittersweet memory of Claudia─of a time when she performed the Little Ladies' Dance for him during a Little Ladies' Day celebration many years ago, only to collapse from exhaustion. Aldiytha would surely wish to be apprised of your discoveries, and so you make ready to return to the Gold Court once more.</td></tr>

Upon hearing what you have to say, she begins to suspect that her father has been keeping secrets from her out of concern for her health, but is interrupted in the midst of her musings by Rodolph's sudden arrival. He informs you both that her father, Fortin, has been worried sick about her since she disappeared from the manor, and is presently searching for her in the vicinity of the Ruby Road Exchange. Asking that you stay by her side so that she can muster the courage to face her father, you set off to meet the stringent head of House Thorne.</td></tr>

He reveals that he hid the truth from Aldiytha because the folding fan and Little Ladies' Dance served as painful reminders of losing the woman he loved. Aldiytha expresses sympathy for how he feels, and then to his amazement, performs the dance to perfection, bringing him back to a Little Ladies' Day long ago, when Claudia once did the same for him. Moved by his daughter's performance, he at last gives in to her wishes, pledging to serve as her seneschal for the remainder of the celebration─as long as she agrees not to push herself. Grateful for your unending support, Aldiytha offers you a replica of the fan and instructions on how to perform the dance yourself. Before you go, she announces her intention to distribute fans and share the history of the dance with as many people as possible, in hopes of making this Little Ladies' Day one to be remembered.</td></tr>
