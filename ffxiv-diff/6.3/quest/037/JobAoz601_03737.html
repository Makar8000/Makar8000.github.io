<tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>TEXT_JOBAOZ601_03737_SEQ_01</td><td>Martyn is joined by P'yandih, Nutiba Buntiba, and Royse in offering their congratulations for your thrilling victory over Siegfried. As the ownership of the Celestium hinged on the outcome of the match, Royse is particularly pleased that the arena and its assets remain under her control. Your vanquished foe also arrives with his father, Fyrgeiss, and admits that you were the better fighter on the day. Following suit, Fyrgeiss confesses that he had misjudged the abilities of blue mages, and Martyn seizes the opportunity to secure gainful employment for his guild with Amajina &amp; Sons. After the wealthy Syndicate member clears the air with Royse, a round of farewells ensues, leaving you with Martyn and his Mamool Ja associates. However, it seems that something is amiss with the guildmaster...</td></tr>

But Martyn has never been one to give in, even when he almost definitely should, and he announces that he will reinvent himself under the new identity of Azuro the Third. He aims to convince the public of Ul'dah that his latest alter ego is the original founder of the Blue Mages' Guild, in order to distance it from the rather ignominious fate that befell the Great Azuro. He will continue to appear in the Masked Carnivale under this new moniker while continuing his research into strategies that blue mages may employ in various fields of combat, and he asks you to participate in further expeditions. Though Martyn maintains his position as guildmaster of the Blue Mages' Guild, it is clear to all involved who the real driving force is, and the junior members will rely on your guidance in the days to come.

※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn once you have met the following requirements:
※ You must have registered a product key for FINAL FANTASY XIV: Stormblood to your service account.
