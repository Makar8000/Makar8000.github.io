<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>79</td><td>The assaults from outside tribes have markedly increased of late. The Geraldines proved an especially barbarous thorn in our sides, their nigh ceaseless pillaging no doubt an effort to hoard supplies in preparation for the coming winter.
No longer able to tolerate the damages suffered by these incursions, the senate issued an order for their king's assassination, and we reapers were asked to ready our blades.

With three of her fellows in tow, Galatea set out under cover of night and infiltrated the enemy fortress. Their mission was a great success which soon put the enemy to rout.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>80</td><td>Emperor Solus is convinced this &lt;Emphasis&gt;magitek&lt;/Emphasis&gt; will spark a revolution in warfare as we know it. And as he devotes further resources to its advancement, our arts continue to fall out of favor. I fear the age of the reaper has come to an end.

After all our forebears have sacrificed for the good of the Empire. The blood spilled, the lives lost. They would dare deem us relics of a bygone era.
Indeed, they believe the future lies with their “reaper” battle armor.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>81</td><td>Aspirants are reminded not to approach the figures of the Pale Harvest without express permission. They should be treated with no less reverence than Galatea herself, and are hardly less dangerous.

Only those who have successfully forged a pact with an avatar may spar with the Galatea Parva. They will serve to refine one's use of invocations and tactical coordination.

The Galatea Magna, however, is reserved for those who are able to serve as host to their avatar. This periculous manikin is designed to push a reaper to their limits, if not beyond them.
Learn to walk in death's shadow, and you shall know no fear.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>82</td><td>Maintenance of the Galateae must be handled with the utmost of care. The delicate art of their making has long since been lost, making repairs difficult, and reproduction all but impossible.

The knowledge was kept secret, passed down to those who would inherit the position of master dollmaker. That is, until one man chose to break with tradition.

He claimed to be leaving on a journey in pursuit of an “unparalleled beauty,” but we never learned the truth of it. The only thing that is certain, is the art of our forebears left with him.</td></tr>
