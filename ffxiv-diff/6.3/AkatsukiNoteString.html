Like those of his brethren, his name is in fact a title─one of the exalted offices of the Convocation of Fourteen, the collective that guided mankind in ancient times.

During the first Final Days, the seat was held by a man named Hermes, who prior to his induction served as chief overseer of Elpis, the testing ground of creation, and was an authority on flying life-forms as well as the celestial sphere. In the course of his work, however, Hermes came to question mankind's single-minded pursuit of perfection, prompting him to create Meteion and her sisters to seek the meaning of life in the distant stars. Alas, an accident caused them all to perish before they could fulfill their purpose...or so it was believed.

In truth, his creations found naught but despair, and concluded that salvation lay only in death. Furthermore, Meteion declared that she herself would usher in their demise. In a moment of madness, Hermes allowed her to pursue her designs, and erased the memories of those who knew what awaited─his own included─that mankind might be put to the proof and prove themselves capable of change and thus worthy of survival.

Ignorant of his deeds, Hermes went on to oppose the Final Days with all his being, as he himself had intended. His knowledge proved instrumental in forestalling the Final Days, and the formulation of the plan to sacrifice half their number to manifest the mighty Zodiark. This first primal served to shield the star from Meteion's song of oblivion, but would later be sundered into fourteen parts alongside all creation by His counterpart, Hydaelyn.

Ironically, in forcibly erasing his memories, Hermes engraved them deeper upon his soul. In the millennia that followed, the cycle of death and rebirth would lead him to recall the forgotten truth: that the architect of the apocalypse abided at the edge of the universe.

One of the incarnations who inherited a shard of Hermes's tormented soul was a man named Amon, a brilliant technologist who rose to prominence in the Allagan Empire just as it was falling into decline. A victim of its prosperity, the empire had grown stagnant; the people delighted in debauchery, and science was no more than a means to amuse the decadent masses. Lamenting this state of affairs, Amon resolved to resurrect the founding father, Emperor Xande, that he might restore the empire to its former glory. And though he succeeded in his unholy endeavor, the emperor, having once experienced death, had been forever changed by the knowledge. Seeking to return all to nothingness, he set in motion events that would lead to the empire’s undoing. But before Allag was consigned to oblivion, the Ascians, wishing to make use of Amon's singular talents, called him to serve as the new Fandaniel.

In receiving of the Ascian mantle, Fandaniel regained the missing pieces of his past and recalled the truth of the Final Days in its entirety. After the three unsundered Ascians met their ends, he forged an alliance with Zenos in order to take control of Zodiark. His heart was a maelstrom of righteous anger and all-consuming despair, twisted further by the remnants of the dreams that had haunted him as Amon─of an ancient world rent asunder by a calamity well deserved.

Ultimately, he did not bear witness to the conclusion of the tale he had written. Having fallen as Zodiark, his soul was subsequently dragged into the depths of the aetherial sea by the spiteful Asahi, and he would never know if the Warrior of Light and &lt;If(PlayerParameter(4))&gt;her&lt;Else/&gt;his&lt;/If&gt; comrades managed to overcome the despair that had broken him so utterly.→One of the sundered Ascians, Fandaniel first appeared before the Warrior of Light in the body of the late Asahi sas Brutus.

<tr><td></td><td>77</td><td>A century before─by that reflection's measure of time─the Warrior of Light and &lt;If(PlayerParameter(4))&gt;her&lt;Else/&gt;his&lt;/If&gt; companions journeyed to the First, it underwent a terrible transformation which forever changed the world. A failed Ascian attempt to set in motion an Eighth Umbral Calamity on the Source triggered a Flood of Light, which then swept across the land, leaving naught but blank perfection in its wake.

The tale of the Flood is one of hubris and tragedy. Hoping to restore peace to an embattled world, brave Warriors of Light fought and felled the Shadowkeeper, steward of Darkness─but in their decisive victory unbalanced the cosmic scales. Though Hydaelyn's agent, the Oracle of Light, managed to stem the ravenous tide and prevent the First's utter annihilation, much was lost. Only Norvrandt─a region the approximate size of Eorzea─remained habitable.

Contrary to traditional associations between light and the astral, the Light that consumed the First is characterized by passivity and tranquility─what scholars of the Source would term “umbral” polarity. Thus did the lands claimed by the Flood, known as the “Empty,” come to reach a state of stasis utterly bereft of aetheric activity. Norvrandt itself would be cursed with an empty sky of unyielding Light and ravenous hordes of Light-warped creatures.

Save for the greatest among them─the Lightwardens─these “sin eaters” are largely mindless beings, seeking only to corrupt the aether of the living and give rise to more of their own. Nevertheless, for the First's remaining population, it has been a constant struggle to keep these fiends at bay. Only since the Scions of the Seventh Dawn arrived to destroy the extant Lightwardens and purge Norvrandt of Light's corruption have its people known a measure of peace. They yet pay homage to their heroes as “Warriors of Darkness” for their role in restoring the night sky.</td></tr>

<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>81</td><td class="modify">→Son of House Leveilleur, it was at the tender age of eleven that Alphinaud and his twin sister, Alisaie, were accepted into the prestigious Studium. There, he specialized in the study of arcane entities, history and natural history, and pursued advanced studies in the magical arts and aetherology. Upon graduating at sixteen, the Sharlayan age of adulthood, he resolved to sail for Eorzea in spite of his father's objections. Alphinaud has since worked to see his grandfather's wishes made reality. It is why he joined the Scions, and later why he founded the Crystal Braves. With the latter, however, the Ul'dahn elite utilized Alphinaud's inflated confidence to their advantage, wresting the Braves from his control and delivering the young man a bitter defeat.

Swallowing his despair, Alphinaud traveled with the Warrior of Light and Tataru to Ishgard, a nation locked in the thousand-year Dragonsong War. There he engaged with various factions and individuals who sought to resolve the conflict in their own way, among them Archbishop Thordan VII, Ser Aymeric, the Azure Dragoon Estinien, and the heretic Ysayle. The experience prompted him to reevaluate his view of the world as well as his purpose, and as the war neared its conclusion, he reached his own: he would not be a man who sacrifices friends and family for a cause. In spite of the risk to himself, he swore to rescue Estinien, who had been corrupted by the influence of Nidhogg's shade, and with the aid of the Warrior of Light succeeded in saving the dragoon's life.

Alphinaud's involvement in the provincial rebellions that followed taught him further life lessons. He saw firsthand the crushing defeat dealt to the Ala Mhigan Resistance in Rhalgr's Reach by Zenos and the XIIth Imperial Legion. Undeterred, the young Scion then journeyed to the Far East with his comrades, braving haunted seas, and helped the Domans to free themselves from imperial rule. Having won an ally in Hien, Doma's rightful king, he returned to Eorzea to once more aid the Ala Mhigans in their fight against the Empire. At length the Eorzean Alliance laid siege to Ala Mhigo, where Zenos ruled as viceroy, and succeeded in vanquishing the imperial occupiers. With peace thus restored to the land, Alphinaud enjoyed a moment of adventure as he joined the Warrior of Light and fellow Scion Arenvald in a quest for lost treasure.

In the course of these experiences, Alphinaud learned of the Populares, a moderate faction in Garlean politics that sought to bring change to its provincial policy. Together with one of its members, a soldier named Maxima, he embarked on a diplomatic mission to the imperial capital. An unexpected attack en route put a premature end to his plans, but his subsequent chance meeting with Gaius led to another opportunity. Long thought dead, the former legatus had taken to working independently in the shadows, and their encounter resulted in an unlikely alliance that set in motion events which would alter the course of history.

After coming to the First, Alphinaud applied himself earnestly and continued to ponder the true meaning of salvation. He did not shrink before Lord Vauthry, the godlike mayor of Eulmore, who believed himself to be mankind's sole deliverance, nor did he hesitate to voice his opposition when Emet-Selch revealed his intent to restore the past at the cost of the future. By these acts, he showed that the salvation that he had once striven to bring to others had transcended hollow ideals and become a tangible endeavor. And in the face of the Telophoroi threat in the Source, his long-held dream was realized with the formation of the Grand Company of Eorzea. With the combined might of not only the city-states but the myriad tribes besides, this organization united the realm in a way its ignominious precursor, the Crystal Braves, could not.

As he continued to walk his long path, Alphinaud was unexpectedly reunited with his father Fourchenault. In their first meeting since he left Sharlayan behind, he was made to question the wisdom of his course─of going to war to effect change. But encouraged by his comrades, his sister Alisaie not least of all, he was able to find his answer: for those he holds dear, he would always choose to fight.

Even now, with the Final Days averted, Alphinaud labors on behalf of those in need. And he will ever do so, forging ahead one step at a time towards the better tomorrow he envisions.</td></tr>

<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>85</td><td class="modify">→Alisaie is Alphinaud's twin sister—though she dislikes that their similarity leads people to mistake her for her brother. Though unmistakably a prodigy, she has, in their sixteen years together, always trailed ever so slightly behind him. Her grandfather, however, never treated her as secondary, and as such Alisaie clearly misses Louisoix dearly, still holding him in higher regard than any other.

Shortly after Alisaie gained admission to the Studium at the age of eleven, Louisoix resolved to return to Eorzea in order to save the realm from the Seventh Umbral Calamity. His son Fourchenault attempted to dissuade him, asserting that the wise abjure conflict, but the elder Archon responded with words that have remained in Alisaie's heart: “To ignore the plight of those one might conceivably save is not wisdom─it is indolence. We must all protect that which we hold most dear in the manner of our own choosing.” Louisoix upheld his creed to the end, and vanished amidst the fire and fury of the Calamity.

Wishing to know the fate of her beloved grandfather and what he had sacrificed himself for, Alisaie journeyed to Eorzea together with Alphinaud years later. Disappointment awaited her, as she found all the city-states struggling with fundamental problems, with none making any progress towards addressing them. Distancing herself from her brother and the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, who proactively aided the nations, she struck out on her own to investigate the truth of the Calamity─and better understand the realm.

In the course of her solitary endeavors, Alisaie uncovered a scheme between the Warriors of Darkness and the Ascians, with her family friend Urianger somehow involved. Seeking to thwart their plot to sow chaos, as well as ascertain Urianger's allegiance, she made the decision to join with the Scions formally.

Since then, Alisaie has fought fearlessly on the front lines. Taking up the rapier in place of the grimoire she received from her grandfather, she played a key role in the liberation of both Doma and Ala Mhigo before helping to save the First from all-consuming Light. Countless times has she been cast down, battered and discouraged, but never has she failed to rise up again and carry on the fight. And in the course of her struggles, she came to accept her grandfather's wisdom and likewise love the world that he gave his life to protect.

During her time in the First, Alisaie tended to the Light-afflicted souls who were living out their days at the Inn at Journey's Head. Determined to save a boy named Halric, it was by her initiative that a cure for sin eater corruption was devised. The method was subsequently adapted into a treatment for tempering─a condition long held to be irreversible─and used to cure not only the koboldling Ga Bu, but the countless people whom the Telophoroi had transformed into the primal Anima's mindless thralls.

In the chaos of the Final Days as well, Alisaie showed unfaltering courage. When the enemy came in force, she charged into the fray; when souls wanted for succor, she rushed to their aid. In this way she lived up to her grandfather's words, protecting that which she holds dear in the manner of her own choosing.

Through it all, Alisaie's sights have never strayed from one individual: the Warrior of Light. Driven by the desire to stand shoulder to shoulder with the hero, she strives to better herself that she may one day count herself &lt;If(PlayerParameter(4))&gt;her&lt;Else/&gt;his&lt;/If&gt; equal.</td></tr>

<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>88</td><td class="modify">→The Garlean Empire once controlled the majority of the Three Great Continents, the enormous landmass that encompasses Eorzea. Until some fifty years ago, Garlemald was a remote and sparsely populated nation which held little more than a fraction of the northern continent of Ilsabard. But with the arrival of a technological golden age and the concurrent emergence of a brilliant young legatus, Solus Galvus, in the span of a single generation Garlemald established itself as one of the most formidable forces in all of Hydaelyn.

Garlemald is unsurpassed in the field of magitek, a technology which it exploits with devastating effectiveness in warfare. Unperturbed by their lesser numbers, the Garleans went forth upon gigantic flying warships, bearing powerful weaponry the likes of which the world had never seen. One nation after the next fell before their relentless onslaught, first those of the northlands, followed by the sovereign states of the eastern continent, Othard. Employing suppression and conciliation in equal measure, Garlemald indoctrinated the peoples it conquered, thus integrating them into its ever-expanding territory. So it was that the Garlean Empire came into existence.

In the year 1557 of the Sixth Astral Era, the Garleans brought their campaign of conquest to Eorzea, swiftly bringing the city–state of Ala Mhigo to its knees. Yet following the subjugation of Ala Mhigo, the Empire suddenly ceased its aggressive expansion.

For a time, it seemed as though the Empire's complete subjugation of the world was all but inevitable. However, Emperor Solus's failing health and eventual death triggered a war of succession, and following a protracted campaign on Eorzean soil, Gaius van Baelsar and his XIVth Legion suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the newly unified Eorzean Alliance. Thus did cracks begin to appear in the Empire's armor, and as the Scions of the Seventh Dawn continued to intervene on behalf of the oppressed, the Garleans went on to lose control of Doma in the east and Ala Mhigo in the west. To compound their woes, the new emperor, Varis, had scarcely won the throne before he was slain by his son Zenos, who had an agenda all his own.

Zenos then colluded with the Ascian Fandaniel, and using his father's corpse as a medium, summoned forth the primal Anima. The imperial capital, which had become the stage for a bloody civil war, fell silent as nearly every soldier and civilian remaining was turned into a tempered slave.

Though both Anima and the Telophoroi have since been eliminated, Garlemald struggles to recover from the devastation. The leaders of the subjugated territories bide their time, making no moves to resurrect the fallen Empire, and it remains to be seen what the future holds.</td></tr>

<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>91</td><td class="modify">→The term magitek collectively refers to the advanced technology widely employed by the Garlean Empire. Utilizing ceruleum as a source of power, it has found practical applications in all aspects of life, from everyday conveniences such as heaters and radios, to weapons of destruction such as flying warships.

The history of magitek can be traced back to the year 1513, when a man named Solus Galvus attained the rank of legatus. The twenty-four-year-old Garlean learned of the newly invented ceruleum engine, and saw great potential in it. His was the hand that guided the development of magitek weapons, and his the mind that devised tactics for these warmachina. Galvus also saw them integrated into the army, and so imbued the military with mechanical might.

Innately ungifted in magic, the Garleans once relied upon mages recruited from foreign lands to bolster their armies. Not only did magitek free them from that dependence─it transformed them into a machine of conquest.</td></tr>

Winters in the Garleans' new home were harsh. The northern seas were bound in ice for most of the year, and the resources of the waters were available for only a slim window. Likewise, farming and rearing animals were possible only at certain times. The land, in other words, could not support a large populace. The Garleans multiplied slowly, and over time were forced to accept being few in number.

There was but one benefit to the frigid land—its vast deposits of ceruleum. This deep-blue liquid burned as well as oil, and kept the hearth warm during the long, dark times of year. Indeed, had it not been for this natural resource, the Garleans would not have survived the severe winter cold. Yet, it was to be a long time before the advent of the ceruleum engine, and the Garleans realized what a boon this liquid was.</td></tr>
