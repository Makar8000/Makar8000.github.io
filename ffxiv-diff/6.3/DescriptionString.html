Ceruleum is required to operate machina. A maximum of 100 units of ceruleum can be stored by each party.

Each time a player incapacitates an enemy player, they are awarded a knockout (K). When a player is incapacitated, they are classed as “down” (D). If a player deals damage to an enemy that is then incapacitated by a teammate, they are awarded an assist (A). The final K, D, and A for each player is displayed on the results screen at the end of the battle.

By continually winning Frontline matches, players will receive achievements that reward special mounts and gear.

・An effect increasing attack speed and movement speed for a short time.
・A boost to the limit gauge.

A daily fee of seafarer's cowries will be required to maintain your crops. Maintenance will be suspended if seafarer's cowries are insufficient, your supply of seeds has been exhausted, or if yields have accumulated to the maximum of 50. Plots will be marked “Under Care” if maintenance is proceeding smoothly and “Care Halted” if maintenance has been suspended.

To begin, enable Feed mode from the islekeep's index, then approach an animal in the pasture equipped with the feed item of your choice to give it the tasty treat it deserves.

Feeding an animal will improve its mood and sate its appetite.

■Feed
There are three different types of animal feed available:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed, and premium island greenfeed.

Each feed can be crafted via the Sanctuary Crafting Log, and both types of greenfeed require produce yielded from the cropland.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Hostile,” “Unhappy,” “Content,” “Chipper,” and “Gleeful.”&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

・Island Sweetfeed
Improves an animal's mood by &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;one level.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; Can improve the mood up to &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;content&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Gleeful,” “Chipper,” “Content,” “Unhappy,” and “Hostile.”&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

For those islekeeps who feel like they have a firm grasp on the basics, the following tips will help you take your island industry─and earnings─to the next level.


■Popular Items Sell Even Better When Scarce
When a handicraft has High or Very High popularity, the inclination may be to produce large quantities of it, as popularity increases selling price. However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.

By waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.

Demand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.


■Start the Season Short and Efficient
Levels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.

To quickly activate efficiency bonsues, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Strategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;→Mastering the intricacies of isleworks production and trade begins with a close examination of the materials available to you and the strategic implementation of efficiency bonuses.
