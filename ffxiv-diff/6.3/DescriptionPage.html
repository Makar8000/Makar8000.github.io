When discarding a tile, there is always a risk that an opponent may claim that tile to strengthen their position or even win the hand. These markers indicate which tiles carry a high risk of being claimed by an opponent.
Remember, even the tiles without markers are not entirely without risk, but enabling this feature may help you to avoid defeat.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086045.tex</td><td>The most dangerous tiles will have this kind of marker.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086046.tex</td><td>You should also be wary of tiles with these markers.</td><td></td><td>■ Hints
Enable this feature for recommendations on which tiles to discard, whether to call pon or chi, and so on. While following this advice will not always lead to victory, you may find it useful.

Mercenaries are also governed by the Contractual Obligation status, and they will leave the field of battle once the status counts down to zero. After a certain amount of time passes, they will reappear from their respective base and will no longer be allied with either team.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086044.tex</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td></tr>

■The Auto-demolition Process
　1. Estate halls which have not been entered by their owner for thirty days (Earth time) will be designated abandoned and scheduled for auto-demolition.

　2. Once the estate hall has not been entered for a total of forty-five days (Earth time), it will be demolished, and the plot will be put up for sale.
While any member of a free company may enter a company estate hall to prevent auto-demolition, only the owner can prevent the auto-demolition of a private estate.

■Reclaiming Funds and Furnishings Following Auto-demolition
In the event your estate is demolished and your plot is sold, you will be able to claim indemnification for 80% of the plot's value. Furthermore, furnishings which can be safely removed will be stored for safekeeping by the resident caretaker. However, you must speak with the resident caretaker within thirty-five days (Earth time) of auto-demolition to reclaim funds and furnishings.
In the case of free company estates, this can only be performed by members with authority to purchase and relinquish land.

Players will be randomly assigned to one of these three teams, regardless of their Grand Company allegiance. Each team consists of up to 24 players in an alliance, allowing for a grand total of 72 players in a single battle.

A Frontline alliance consists of 24 members, divided into 3 full parties. There are 3 alliances, which combine for a total of 72 participants.
A match lasts for 20 minutes.

■Retaliation
Incapacitated players will be returned to their Grand Company's landing, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay. This will not incur a weakness penalty.
Furthermore, players will be temporarily invulnerable when leaving their Grand Company's landing.

■Mounts
Players are free to use mounts during Frontline campaigns. However, players taking damage while mounted will be afflicted with the Limp status effect.

■Return
Using Return will teleport players back to their landing point. Moreover, this action has no recast time during Frontline campaigns. Please note, however, casting will be interrupted by attacks.

■KDA
Each time a player incapacitates an enemy player, they are awarded a knockout (K). When a player is incapacitated, they are classed as “down” (D). If a player deals damage to an enemy that is then incapacitated by a teammate, they are awarded an assist (A). The final K, D, and A for each player is displayed on the results screen at the end of the battle.

■Rewards
When a match has ended, players will receive PvP EXP, PvE EXP, Wolf Marks, and Allagan tomestones.

To win, one team must move the tactical crystal from the center of the field to the goal point. If neither team accomplishes this during the time limit, the match will proceed into overtime.

During overtime, the victory conditions differ depending on both teams' progress. “Progress” indicates the maximum progress a team has made in bringing the tactical crystal toward their goal at any point during the match─as opposed to its current position relative to either goal─and thus will never decrease even should the crystal be reclaimed by the opposing team. Progress is displayed on the HUD throughout the match.

・Should your team have the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime, you must keep the entire opposing team out of the ring around the tactical crystal for three seconds to win.

・Should the opposing team have the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime, you must beat their progress score during overtime to win.

・Should the teams have equal progress scores upon the commencement of overtime, you must beat the opposing team's progress score during overtime to win.→&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;■Victory Conditions■&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

To begin, enable Feed mode from the islekeep's index, then approach an animal in the pasture equipped with the feed item of your choice to give it the tasty treat it deserves.

Feeding an animal will improve its mood and sate its appetite.

■Feed
There are three different types of animal feed available:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed, and premium island greenfeed.

Each feed can be crafted via the Sanctuary Crafting Log, and both types of greenfeed require produce yielded from the cropland.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Hostile,” “Unhappy,” “Content,” “Chipper,” and “Gleeful.”&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

・Island Sweetfeed

For those islekeeps who feel like they have a firm grasp on the basics, the following tips will help you take your island industry─and earnings─to the next level.


■Popular Items Sell Even Better When Scarce
When a handicraft has High or Very High popularity, the inclination may be to produce large quantities of it, as popularity increases selling price. However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.

By waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.

Demand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.


■Start the Season Short and Efficient
Levels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.

To quickly activate efficiency bonsues, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Strategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;→Mastering the intricacies of isleworks production and trade begins with a close examination of the materials available to you and the strategic implementation of efficiency bonuses.
