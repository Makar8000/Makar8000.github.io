<tr><td></td><td>21</td><td></td><td>The Houses of Lords and Commons have approved large-scale works to restore the Holy See of Ishgard. The principal site for the project is the Firmament district, which sustained extensive damage during the war.

Willing and able hands are sought to contribute to the reconstruction effort, regardless of birth and origin. Foreign experts will primarily be tasked with technical oversight along with the preparation and procurement of supplies.

Contributions are rewarded by way of skybuilders' scrips, which may be exchanged in the district for myriad wares. For more information, please seek out Enie.

All participants are urged to refer to this notice board often for project news such as pending works.

We thank you for your part in rebuilding our great nation.</td><td></td></tr>

Next, allow me to apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced during the previous phase of works. So great were the number of willing hands, we were figuratively and literally overwhelmed, but I pledge that we will do better by our valued builders in future.

For the current phase of the restoration, we shall build the New Nest, a residential quarter intended for those who lost their homes in the fires of war. Works will begin with the construction of the main thoroughfare, the Mattock. My humble thanks in advance for your contribution to the cause.

Once you have collected five stamps, you may exchange the voucher for a Kupo of Fortune card. Upon each card, there are four treasure chests depicted by hexagons─one on the left and three on the right. You may choose one chest to scratch open.

The lone chest on the left offers second to fourth prize, while the three chests on the right offer first to fifth, with the fifth being a consolation prize. The prizes available change each time, and we recommend that you review the prize list before playing.

Simply by donating supplies, you could win rare and fabulous prizes! Seek out Lizbeth to test your luck!</td><td></td></tr>

For safety reasons, materials thus obtained in the Diadem must undergo inspection. Upon returning from a foray, we ask that you please present all items to our resource inspector, Flotpassant. You will be awarded an amount in skybuilders' scrips by way of recompense.
