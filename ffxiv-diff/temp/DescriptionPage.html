■The Auto-demolition Process
　1. Estate halls which have not been entered by their owner for thirty days (Earth time) will be designated abandoned and scheduled for auto-demolition.

　2. Once the estate hall has not been entered for a total of forty-five days (Earth time), it will be demolished, and the plot will be put up for sale.
While any member of a free company may enter a company estate hall to prevent auto-demolition, only the owner can prevent the auto-demolition of a private estate.

■Reclaiming Funds and Furnishings Following Auto-demolition
In the event your estate is demolished and your plot is sold, you will be able to claim indemnification for 80% of the plot's value. Furthermore, furnishings which can be safely removed will be stored for safekeeping by the resident caretaker. However, you must speak with the resident caretaker within thirty-five days (Earth time) of auto-demolition to reclaim funds and furnishings.
In the case of free company estates, this can only be performed by members with authority to purchase and relinquish land.
