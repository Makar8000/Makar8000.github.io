Vergilia, having vague recollections of her time enthralled to Anima, believes she knows where to find it. Knowing where to begin your search, Lorens suggests splitting into two groups─a small unit to breach the facility holding Varis's heart, and another together with your main force to breach the tower of Babil once its defenses are down.
