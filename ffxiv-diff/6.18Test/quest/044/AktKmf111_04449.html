His parlor tricks are of no moment with the erstwhile Lady Iceheart shielding you once more, yet you struggle to destroy him once and for all. Instead, it is the vengeful spirit of Asahi who brings an end to the man that was once Hermes, many times Fandaniel, but Amon at the last, leaving the path to Hydaelyn open before you.</td></tr>
