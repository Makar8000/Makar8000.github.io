The presence of what they believe to be a blasphemy, however, keeps them from ascending the Tower of Babil and traveling to their destination. As such, nation leaders, both near and far, have elected to combine their forces to root out this threat. To better assess the situation, Lucia suggests speaking with members of the reconnaissance team that first encountered the blasphemy that bars their path.</td></tr>
