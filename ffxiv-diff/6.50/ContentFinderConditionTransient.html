Yet with plenty often comes peril, and the vicious beasts that live there will not so readily relinquish their claim to the island's lifeblood. Will you secure the energy you need to breach the void─or be returned to the very flows of aether you seek?</td></tr>

It is there, within the recesses of the Thirteenth's moon, Zeromus bides its time, gathering the strength that will see Golbez's plan to fruition. But what else could he be guarding in this subterranean labyrinth? What secrets might be laid bare by those willing to brave its abyssal depths?</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>950</td><td>In a world bereft of Light and death's release, where to live is to devour or be devoured, Golbez had concocted his crusade. Though he had minions to carry out his will, he ultimately trusted none but himself and abided in solitude for thousands of years. What was it that sustained him through such a purgatory as he sought to enact his dark designs? It is this question which lingers on the wandering minstrel's mind, inspiring him with a new verse. As you listen to his solemn dirge of the black-clad villain's unforgivable deeds, your thoughts race back to that terrible clash of wills upon the moon of the Thirteenth, where Azdaja's fate hung in the balance...</td></tr>

To answer that love, you must sally forth into their sanctum one last time to grant them their heart's desire. Oschon─or Deryk, as you had known him─awaits with his brethren Thaliak and Llymlaen in their heavenly domain.

In the red moon's answer to the Cradle of Darkness did he use that aether to birth the dread voidsent Zeromus, which, driven by Azdaja's longing to return home, is now poised to break the barrier between worlds. And so the Warrior of Light stands fast against the Darkness, a flickering beacon of hope. Should they fail, the Thirteenth's deliverance will prove the Source's destruction.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>965</td><td>Fueled by a yearning not its own, the voidsent Zeromus was poised to shatter the barrier between worlds. Its passage would be halted thanks in part to another denizen of the void, one who wielded splendorous Light to change both her fate and that of the Thirteenth. Yet what if Light's refulgence proved too great for this voidsent vagabond steeped in Darkness? Would aught else have stayed Zeromus's hand? These questions and more fuel the Wandering Minstrel's imagination as he weaves his benighted ballad, its measured tones calling your mind back to a most harrowing encounter.</td></tr>
