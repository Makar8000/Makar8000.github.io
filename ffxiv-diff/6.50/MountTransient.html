With the merchant being too busy to personally tend to it, however, its care fell to Khloe Aliapoh, whose attentive hand and rousing tales allowed it to grow into a large specimen with a luminescent blossom.</td><td>The smell of the sea is sending

The ceruleum-powered rotary tiller makes short work of transforming rough terrain, while the cargo tray is ideal for transporting materials and passengers both.</td><td>This untamed isle is yours

As luck would have it, the tides delivered her to a desert island, whose fertile soil and sunshine allowed her to attain enormous proportions.</td><td>Honestly, I've never seen

From the castaway vegetable, he learned about the great wide world beyond the island's bounds, and began to dream of embarking upon grand adventures.</td><td>I have oft heard it said that a blossom's beauty

believed it until I met you two desert roses.
