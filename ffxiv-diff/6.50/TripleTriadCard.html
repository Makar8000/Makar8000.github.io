She is greatly revered in Gridania, and the deity's more warlike incarnation famously graces a recruitment poster for the Order of the Twin Adder. Although mythological tales put her at odds with Halone, the Fury, the two seemed to bear each other no ill will in Euphrosyne.</td></tr>

He commands the element of earth, and is most often depicted as an austere emperor wielding a mythril greataxe. Said to be the first of the Twelve, his presence in Euphrosyne is one characterized by quiet authority, though he seems much softened in dealings with his younger sister, Nymeia.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>396</td><td>Nymeia</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>Nymeia, the watcher of celestial bodies and goddess of fate, stood at her brother Althyk's side in Euphrosyne to test the might of mortals. Often depicted as a weaver donning a white, silken veil, her name is appended to the Nymeia lily for the resemblance the flower's petals have to her pale adornment.</td></tr>

Described in myth as Oschon's lover, the tale of the bathing Llymlaen hurling a sword at him for peeping is generally agreed to be the later fabrication of whimsical bards.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>400</td><td>Oschon</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>Oschon is ruler of the mountains and god of wanderers and vagrants. Depicted as a carefree ranger wielding a bow of yew, the majestic peaks and howling winds of the world are said to be of his divine creation. Oschon is the explorer Deryk's true form, and it was he who brought mortals to the Omphalos to fulfill the Twelve's behest.</td></tr>
