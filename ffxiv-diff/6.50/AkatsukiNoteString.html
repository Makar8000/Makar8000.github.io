<tr><td></td><td>105</td><td>Like Hydaelyn, Zodiark is one of the eldest and most powerful of primals. To define what exactly He is, one must first define Light and Darkness─polar opposites whose core components differ from the six main elements of which the star is composed.

The ancients classified Light as that which governs tranquility and stasis. It is a pure white energy bereft of color or movement, and in modern terminology, an element of this nature would be defined as “umbral.” In contrast, Darkness was classified as that which spurs growth. It is an energy of deepest black─a cacophony of life's myriad colors─and contemporary scholars would define elements of this active nature as “astral.” As such, Zodiark is Darkness and activity given form, while Hydaelyn, who would be His undoing, was conceived as the embodiment of peace and Light everlasting. In the world unsundered, these concepts lacked any associations with good and evil; Light and Darkness were simply fundamental energies that coexisted in all things.

Approximately twelve thousand years ago, a vast quantity of Darkness was required to forestall the coming of the Final Days, that its dynamic nature might ensure that the celestial currents of Etheirys did not stagnate. So it was that the ancients devised a plan to create a god who would embody Darkness itself, and at the order of the Convocation of Fourteen, half of the star's surviving population gave their lives to bring Zodiark into being.

Serving as the primal's heart was the emissary Elidibus. Though countless ancients sacrificed their physical aether and tethered their very souls to Zodiark, Elidibus, having judged his duties unfinished, created a reflection of himself to keep vigil over his allies. Zodiark's untold power averted disaster for a time...yet those who survived and had come to worship Him sought to perpetuate the cycle of sacrifice. They vowed to reap the new life they had sown in His name to resurrect those who had rendered up their essence to fuel the primal's summoning.

Venat and her followers stood in opposition to Zodiark's faithful. Believing that a new generation should inherit Etheirys, they summoned forth Hydaelyn, a second primal born of collective sacrifice, with Venat to serve as Her heart. And so Hydaelyn brought Her tranquil Light to bear against Zodiark's relentless Darkness in a terrible battle. Hydaelyn narrowly emerged the victor, and with Her final strike sundered Zodiark and the star itself into fourteen shards. With Her enemy fragmented and too weak to resist, Hydaelyn created a moon for each shard─a series of gaols in which the divided Zodiark would be sealed for all eternity.

Outraged by the sundering of their world and their god, the Ascians─those who had belonged to the Convocation of Fourteen─resolved to revive Zodiark and restore the broken world to the paradise it once was. For millennia they plotted against Hydaelyn and Her followers, orchestrating events to achieve their ultimate goal, until one of their own chose to forsake this solemn charge.

The Ascian Fandaniel, upon regaining his memories and understanding his true nature, rejected his role in his brethren's machinations. After learning of Elidibus's defeat on the First, he resolved instead to destroy Zodiark. Using Garlemald as his base of operations, the rogue Ascian orchestrated the summoning of the primal Anima, who would siphon aether from across the star and direct it into the Tower of Babil. Utilizing the tower as an aetheric cannon, Fandaniel crippled the mechanisms on the moon which kept Zodiark imprisoned, and subsequently traveled there to seize control of the elder primal by offering himself as His new heart.

Though the Ascian was laid low by the Warrior of Light, Fandaniel reveled in Zodiark's defeat, as his ultimate goal was the return of the Final Days. In a final act of defiance, Zodiark reached into His chest and shattered His own heart, consigning the elder primal to a permanent death.

With His demise on the Source, it is presumed that the reflections of Zodiark in other shards were destroyed as well, and the once-fettered souls of the ancients are finally free to return to the Lifestream.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>108</td><td>Oracle of Light</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>109</td><td>This young maiden of the First fought the sin eaters alongside the Warrior of Darkness, and played an instrumental role in restoring night to Norvrandt.

It is impossible to speak of Ryne without first speaking of the Oracle of Light, Minfilia. Approximately a century ago, when the Flood of Light threatened to engulf the First, the people of Nabaath Areng bore witness to a woman who single-handedly halted the encroaching radiance. Amidst the tumult, someone was heard crying out “Minfilia”─and so it was that Norvrandt's mysterious savior was named.

Fifteen years later, when the Kingdom of Voeburt fell to sin eaters, a girl was discovered who could not be turned by their corruption. With her hair of spun gold and eyes of clearest sapphire, she bore an uncanny resemblance to the legendary Oracle. Inheriting her name, this Minfilia went on to be a beacon of hope in mankind's struggle against the sin eater threat, but as is the fate of many a soldier, she eventually fell in battle. Some years later, however, another girl would appear who possessed the same distinct features and immunity both. In this way the cycle continued, with a new Minfilia emerging as if to replace the one who had died before her.

This strange phenomenon was brought about by none other than the original Minfilia, the Antecedent of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, who had journeyed from the Source to deliver the First from destruction. Having quelled the Flood, she began reincarnating into the bodies of suitable young girls so that the blessing of Light, the source of resistance to sin eater corruption, might endure. Those who were vessels for Minfilia's soul invariably manifested her features, serving to identify the bearer of the blessing.

Once Vauthry became supreme leader of Eulmore, however, the Oracle was deemed no longer necessary. In truth, Vauthry feared the Oracle and the hope she symbolized, and so he ordered General Ran'jit to find and imprison the next Minfilia to appear. That girl was Ryne (though she was yet to be called thus), and she was locked up deep in the city's dungeon before she had seen five summers. For years she languished there, deprived of the opportunity to develop her powers, until she was rescued by Thancred, whom the Crystal Exarch had summoned from the Source.

The days that followed were filled with excitement and discovery for the young maiden. From Thancred she learned how to live and fight, and over time he became as a father to her. Yet even as she grew closer to him, she began to question his motivations for taking her under his wing. She came to believe it was the original Minfilia that he had sought to save─that he would be happier if she surrendered her body to the woman's soul─and the thought tormented her throughout her journey with the Warrior of Darkness.

In time, the moment of truth would arrive. Tracking down the remaining Lightwardens required that she harness greater power as the Oracle, and it was during a bitter confrontation with Ran'jit that she finally found the strength of will to walk her own path. With Thancred laying his life on the line to secure her escape, she pressed on to inherit her namesake's power and arise as the Oracle in her own right. Driven by the desire to fulfill the legacy of those who went before her, she returned with her hair and eyes restored to their natural hues, and from the man who was her father in all the ways that mattered, she received the name by which she is now known.

With the Lightwardens that once plagued the realm no more, Ryne now dedicates her days to restoring life to the First. Be it bejeweled with stars or a brilliant blue, the sky never fails to remind her of journeys past as well as her family, whose love she feels no matter the distance between them.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>112</td><td>Cid Garlond established the Ironworks in 1562 so that magitek technology might spread throughout Eorzea, lessening the Garlean Empire's dangerous monopoly on the science. With a combination of both Garlean defectors and young Eorzean engineers in its employ, the manufacturers create everything from airships to ceruleum-driven trains. There are even scaled models for the younglings of well-to-do houses.

The company is second to none when it comes to airships, and it was but a twelvemoon after Cid's defection from the Empire that he designed a civilian model completely craftable with Eorzean resources. Since forging their partnership with Highwind Skyways, the Ironworks has produced countless airships, and is largely responsible for the current era's convenience in sky travel.

While Cid remains the president of the company in name, during his five-year absence following the Calamity, it was a woman named Jessie who saw to the everyday management of the Ironworks. It is said that she remains at the company's helm even now, as Cid's duties often lead him far afield, and hers was the hand that signed the contract enlisting former imperial tribunus and engineering prodigy Nero tol Scaeva into their ranks.

Working tirelessly by the motto “Freedom through Technology,” Cid and his fellow engineers have been a reliable source of innovation. Through their inventions, they have provided the Warrior of Light and their comrades with many a vital breakthrough, and they will doubtless continue to do so.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>115</td><td>Long ago, the Crystal Exarch came to a fateful conclusion: only a mighty warrior who could defeat the Lightwardens as well as resist their corruption could deliver salvation to Norvrandt. The sole individual he knew capable of such feats─the Warrior of Light─abided in the Source, and thus did he labor to adapt the Crystal Tower's cross-rift travel capabilities that he might bring the hero unto the First.

Success proved elusive. Even after much time and effort, instead of the Warrior of Light, the Exarch ended up summoning their fellow Scions, and incompletely; only their souls successfully made the journey. Though he could weave for them something akin to corporeal forms, their actual bodies remained locked in slumber in the Source, and the connection between flesh and soul would eventually fail, resulting in death. To wit, it was imperative that he found a way to return his unintended guests safely home.

When teleporting, an individual takes their possessions with them by virtue of recognizing those objects as extensions of the self. It was this mechanism that served as the basis of the solution. Receptacles would be created to hold each of the Scions' souls, which the Warrior of Light, who had been summoned whole and complete, would then carry back across the rift to the Source. The finished product, the spirit vessel, also drew inspiration from white auracite, Moenbryda's ingenious invention for capturing an Ascian soul.

However, one other obstacle had to be overcome: the separation of mind and memory. While the two are intrinsically entwined like words writ upon parchment, the latter is wont to fade when the soul is placed into a vessel. In seeking to ensure that their memories remained intact, the companions looked to Allagan memory transference─a technique which required that their spirit vessels be imbued with royal Allagan blood. This blood was provided by the Exarch himself, and it also served to turn these vessels into keys for controlling the Crystal Tower, whose operation was restricted to the ancient empire's rulers.</td></tr>
