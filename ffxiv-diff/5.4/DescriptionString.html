<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>423</td><td>■The Basics
Designed for solo players, this tournament mode pits registered participants against each other in contests of up to eight opponents.

■How to Participate
Speak with the Open tournament official in the Gold Saucer to register for the next available competition. &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Registration periods last for 30 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time).&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

The tournament will begin when 8 participants have been assembled or once the requisite amount of time has elapsed since the registration period began. If there are fewer than 8 participants available, NPCs will sit in for any missing players. Registration times may be viewed via the Open tournament schedule.

■Rewards
MGP, Triple Triad cards, and other prizes will be awarded at the end of a tournament, with final rankings and win rate determining the reward amount. Titles and items are also available as achievement rewards.

In the case that multiple players earn the same ranking, the MGP amount for the ranking reward will be adjusted accordingly. </td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>424</td><td>■Tournament Style
An Open tournament consists of three matches, with participants earning points based on the outcome of each game: 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and zero points for a loss. At the culmination of the third match, the participant with the most points is declared the victor.

In addition to victory points, the final number of captured cards is also recorded for each match. In the case that participants end the tournament with equal points, the player who most dominated the card grid over the course of the competition is awarded a higher ranking.

■Matching Opponents
For the first match, opponents are decided by pairing off the 8 participants at random. For the second and third matches, players are pit against whomever shares the closest point total at that stage in the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>425</td><td>■Match Rules
Regardless of any other ruleset in play, every Open tournament enforces the Draft rule. This rule guarantees a more balanced playing field by restricting participants to the use of temporary “house” cards.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>426</td><td>At the beginning of the competition, three sets of randomly generated cards will be displayed. Participants must choose one option from each set to build their deck, which will then be locked in for the rest of the tournament.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>427</td><td>Players who lack confidence in their deck-building abilities are encouraged to make use of the &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Recommended&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; button. This handy feature will automatically choose the strongest cards available.

Please note that while card options are randomized for each player, the number of rare cards on offer will always be the same.

■Rulesets
Speak with the tournament official and view the schedule to see which rules will be in effect for the upcoming competitions. Each tournament will be marked as having either a “basic” or “advanced” ruleset.

With the exception of Draft, basic tournaments have no advanced rules in play. All that is required to enjoy these matches is an understanding of the standard Triple Triad rules.

Advanced tournaments are for players who prefer their card battles with an extra layer of complexity. In addition to Draft, these contests will also feature advanced rules such as Same or Plus.

The Open tournament schedule will switch back and forth between basic and advanced rulesets, so you won't need to wait long before your preferred style of competition rolls around!</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>428</td><td>An Invitational tournament is a Triple Triad competition which follows the same basic structure as an Open tournament, with the main difference being that there are no rewards on offer. Participants may also register at any time as either a solo player or as a party.

■How to Participate
Players seeking the thrill of tournament play can form a party and register to enter the Triple Triad Invitational Parlor via the Duty Finder. In the case that a player registers solo, or a party has less than 8 members, the missing numbers will be made up by Triple Triad regulars or Gold Saucer employees.

■Rematches
At the end of an Invitational tournament, you will have the opportunity to organize a rematch. If every player agrees to the rematch, you can begin a new tournament with the current participants without needing to leave or re-register the party. Up to three rematches are available per tournament registration.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>429</td><td>■Setting the Rules
Invitational tournaments have no set rules in play.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>430</td><td>Upon entering the Parlor, the party leader is tasked with deciding which rules will apply during the competition. With the exception of Sudden Death and Random, any combination of up to four different advanced rules can be set. &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Remember: you must deselect Draft if you wish to battle using your own custom-built decks.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

For the sake of a harmonious experience, it is strongly suggested that players agree upon a ruleset before commencing registration!</td></tr>
