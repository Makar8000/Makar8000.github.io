Players begin with 13 tiles and draw a new tile each turn. They must then choose a tile to discard: either the new tile or one of the tiles in their hand. The player to the right then takes a turn, and the process is repeated until the end of the hand.

The first player to complete a winning hand is awarded points. A total of eight hands are played, and the player who finishes with the most points is declared the winner.

■ Number Tiles
There are three suits of number tiles, each ranging from 1 to 9.
</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086002.tex</td><td>■ Honor Tiles
There are two suits of honor tiles: the four wind tiles and the three dragon tiles. Unlike number tiles, they appear in no particular sequence, and therefore cannot be used to form straights. They can only form melds with identical tiles.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086003.tex</td><td>There are 34 varieties of tile, with four of each for a total of 136.

Number tiles and honor tiles can also form matching triplets with identical tiles.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086005.tex</td><td>A winning hand consists of 14 tiles and requires four melds and one matching pair.

A winning hand can be formed in one of two ways:
</td><td></td><td>1. Tsumo: When a tile is drawn
When a winning hand is formed with a tile drawn by the player, the point value is calculated, and each of the other three players pays this point cost.
If the dealer calls a winning hand, the point value is increased by 50%.
If the dealer has to pay another player, they must pay double.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086008.tex</td><td>2. Ron: When another player discards a tile
If a player discards a tile that allows another player to form a winning hand, only the player that discarded the tile must pay.
When the dealer forms a winning hand in this manner, the point value is increased by 50%. However, if the dealer is the player who discarded the tile, only the standard amount is paid.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086009.tex</td><td>The dealer has the advantage of earning 50% more points from a winning hand.
In addition, when a dealer calls the winning hand, the &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;role of dealer does not pass to the next player&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;, thus giving the dealer an opportunity to score even more points.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>

■ Novice Mahjong (Ranked)
This match type is immediately available. After registering as a solo player, you will be matched against other players.
Your performance will affect your rating.
　1st: +30 points　2nd: +15 points　3rd: No change
　4th: 2nd kyu or higher, -10 points
The higher your rank, the more points are lost when finishing 4th.

■ Advanced Mahjong (Ranked)
Only players ranked 1st dan or higher can register. After registering as a solo player, you will be matched against other players.
Ratings are affected as follows:
　1st: +60 points　2nd: +15 points　3rd: No change
　4th: -30 points
The higher your rank, the more points are lost when finishing 4th.

■ Four-player Mahjong (Kuitan enabled)
You must form a party of four players to begin the match. Ratings and ranks are not affected.

</td><td></td><td>■ Rules
・Each player has a certain amount of time to take their turn. A tile will be discarded automatically if that player fails to act within the time limit. This time limit does not apply to four-player mahjong (kuitan enabled/disabled).
・A time limit applies to the period between hands. In addition, if a single hand lasts more than 80 minutes, the following hand will be the last one played. Once that hand ends, the game ends, final placements are decided, and the results are recorded.
・Each game has a time limit of 120 minutes, after which the game will end automatically. Results will not be recorded.
</td><td></td><td>■ Chat
・During a four-player mahjong game, you may chat to the other players.
・Chat can be toggled on and off using the button in the lower right of the screen. Turning chat off will prevent you from sending and receiving messages. On-screen icons indicate whether the other players are participating in the chat.
</td><td></td><td class="modify">■ Rating and Rank
・Matches played in “Novice Mahjong (Ranked)” and “Advanced Mahjong (Ranked)” will affect your rating and rank.
・Your rating starts at 1,500, and will increase or decrease according to your finishing position in each match.
・Although you cannot be demoted while in the lower ranks, progressing to the higher ranks puts you at risk of demotion should you perform poorly.
・Ratings and ranks are calculated only according to the rating of your opponents and your finishing position in the game.
(The number of points with which you end a game is not taken into consideration.)
・Your mahjong rating and rank can be viewed in the Gold Saucer menu, under Mahjong.

・If players log out during a mahjong match, tiles will be discarded automatically when their turn comes around. When players log back in, they will regain control from the next turn onwards.
・If players abandon a match, it will continue without them and their tiles will be discarded automatically. They will also incur the standard penalties for abandoning a duty and will be unable to register for another mahjong match until the previous match ends.
・If players do not enter any commands for a certain amount of time, they will be automatically removed from the match.

<tr><td></td><td>5.2</td><td></td><td>Support Features</td><td></td><td>■ Dangerous Tile Marker
When discarding a tile, there is always a risk that an opponent may claim that tile to strengthen their position or even win the hand. These markers indicate which tiles carry a high risk of being claimed by an opponent.
Remember, even the tiles without markers are not entirely without risk, but enabling this feature may help you to avoid defeat.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086045.tex</td><td>The most dangerous tiles will have this kind of marker.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086046.tex</td><td>You should also be wary of tiles with these markers.</td><td></td><td>■ Hints
Enable this feature for recommendations on which tiles to discard, whether to call pon or chi, and so on. While following this advice will not always lead to victory, you may find it useful.

<tr><td></td><td>10.11</td><td></td><td>12. Relocation</td><td></td><td>It is possible to relocate your estate hall to a new plot. Private estates may be relocated by their owners at will, while free company estates require those with authority to purchase and relinquish land.

When making the purchase, 30% of the minimum value of the old plot will be applied towards the price of the new.

Upon relocation, placed furnishings will be put in the storeroom at the destination plot, save for the chocobo stables and the miniature aetheryte, which will be placed in the garden. In the event that there are too many furnishings to fit in the storeroom, the estate cannot be relocated until they have been removed.

Private chambers and company workshops will be moved in their entirety and retain their state.

Interior fixtures, meanwhile, will remain intact, unless the relocation results in an estate hall with fewer floors. In this case, the fixtures will be lost alongside the floor.

Estate halls which have not been entered by their owner for thirty days (Earth time) cannot be relocated. Furthermore, initiating a relocation has the same effect as the owner entering his or her estate hall, and resets the period until auto-demolition.

Designed for solo players, this tournament mode pits registered participants against each other in contests of up to eight opponents.

■How to Participate
Speak with the Open tournament official in the Gold Saucer to register for the next available competition. &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Registration periods last for 30 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time).&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

The tournament will begin when 8 participants have been assembled or once the requisite amount of time has elapsed since the registration period began. If there are fewer than 8 participants available, NPCs will sit in for any missing players. Registration times may be viewed via the Open tournament schedule.

■Rewards
MGP, Triple Triad cards, and other prizes will be awarded at the end of a tournament, with final rankings and win rate determining the reward amount. Titles and items are also available as achievement rewards.

In the case that multiple players earn the same ranking, the MGP amount for the ranking reward will be adjusted accordingly. </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>

An Open tournament consists of three matches, with participants earning points based on the outcome of each game: 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and zero points for a loss. At the culmination of the third match, the participant with the most points is declared the victor.

In addition to victory points, the final number of captured cards is also recorded for each match. In the case that participants end the tournament with equal points, the player who most dominated the card grid over the course of the competition is awarded a higher ranking.

■Matching Opponents
For the first match, opponents are decided by pairing off the 8 participants at random. For the second and third matches, players are pit against whomever shares the closest point total at that stage in the tournament.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>

Regardless of any other ruleset in play, every Open tournament enforces the Draft rule. This rule guarantees a more balanced playing field by restricting participants to the use of temporary “house” cards.</td><td></td><td>At the beginning of the competition, three sets of randomly generated cards will be displayed. Participants must choose one option from each set to build their deck, which will then be locked in for the rest of the tournament.</td><td></td><td>Players who lack confidence in their deck-building abilities are encouraged to make use of the &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Recommended&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; button. This handy feature will automatically choose the strongest cards available.

Please note that while card options are randomized for each player, the number of rare cards on offer will always be the same.

■Rulesets
Speak with the tournament official and view the schedule to see which rules will be in effect for the upcoming competitions. Each tournament will be marked as having either a “basic” or “advanced” ruleset.

With the exception of Draft, basic tournaments have no advanced rules in play. All that is required to enjoy these matches is an understanding of the standard Triple Triad rules.

Advanced tournaments are for players who prefer their card battles with an extra layer of complexity. In addition to Draft, these contests will also feature advanced rules such as Same or Plus.

The Open tournament schedule will switch back and forth between basic and advanced rulesets, so you won't need to wait long before your preferred style of competition rolls around!</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>

Players seeking the thrill of tournament play can form a party and register to enter the Triple Triad Invitational Parlor via the Duty Finder. In the case that a player registers solo, or a party has less than 8 members, the missing numbers will be made up by Triple Triad regulars or Gold Saucer employees.
