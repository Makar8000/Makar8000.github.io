<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>1</td><td class="modify">→Sinus Ardorum is in dire need of materials to support the construction and development of the Moongate Hub, an intrastellar transportation system, on-site domiciles, and infrastructure necessary for travel to other stars. Of these materials, metal plating is some of the highest in demand, specifically that which meets the strict regulations of cosmic exploration. We seek talented crafters capable of fulfilling our metallurgical needs.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>2</td><td class="modify">→Lunar adamantite is a mineral unique to the moon, but it seems that the samples collected within Sinus Ardorum exhibit even greater durability than what we've encountered thus far─a property that could prove extremely useful in the construction of starships and various other moon-based facilities. We call upon skilled metalworkers to forge a steady supply of ingots from our stockpiled ore that we might explore and develop new applications for use in our cosmic initiative.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>3</td><td class="modify">→The Cosmic Exploration Initiative employs a wide range of machinery, but supplying individually tailored parts for the maintenance of each device on-site would lead to astronomical operation costs. To alleviate this expense, we've imposed a “cosmic standard” on all basic components used in our equipment. Recent reports cite an alarming shortage of the joints and shafts needed to keep the facilities running, and we are welcoming all contributions forged to the aforementioned specifications.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>4</td><td class="modify">→As the initiative grows in scale, more mission members are reporting that they lack the necessary tools to carry out their work, or that they must work with tools in poor repair. If this is allowed to continue, it will have a serious impact on efficiency and morale. To ensure that our mission stays on course, we request contributions of equipment, with a focus on those that have been prone to shortage.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>5</td><td class="modify">→Our researchers have discovered meteorites in the Fallen Tears that yield a range of useful minerals. However, an analysis has revealed that there are volatile elements in their composition, and an experienced hand is required in their processing. We seek skilled artisans to test refine the raw materials to determine whether they can be a viable resource for the initiative.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>6</td><td class="modify">→As appears to be characteristic of Sharlayan itself, the initiative has been welcoming new members from all corners of Etheirys. Thus, when it comes to devising a comforting “home away from home” environment for this eclectic cohort, simply borrowing elements from any singular culture will not suffice. We request all veteran artisans to submit recreations of Etheirys furnishings that we might build a broad selection of regional styles.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>7</td><td class="modify">→For our next round of testing, we'd like to ascertain the degree of precision crafting that can be attained using the moon's native materials. Replicating Etheirys's engineered goods will provide us an initial reference point, but we are hopeful that the lessons learned during this process will be applicable to future initiative projects. Ideally, these parts will be used to improve Moongate Hub facilities, so contributing artisans should concentrate on demonstrating fine detail while also preserving the necessary function. </td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>8</td><td class="modify">→Although the moon is bathed in the same sunlight and starlight as Etheirys, the lack of atmosphere to scatter this light makes for dark skies and darker shadows. In order to maintain a properly lit working environment throughout our facilities, we request that all available artisans turn their hands to the manufacture of specified illumination devices.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>9</td><td class="modify">→Several of our new Etheirys colleagues have lodged complaints concerning Sinus Ardorum's “cold,” “dark,” and “impractical” working conditions. While we are unable to address every source of dissatisfaction, requests for improvement are taken very seriously as we strive to provide the most comfortable environment possible. Qualified artisans are encouraged to participate in this endeavor through the manufacture of optimized tools and equipment.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>10</td><td class="modify">→Expeditions into the lunar nadir have detected promising sources of liquid and gaseous fuels which, when properly researched and developed, will prove highly valuable in future initiative applications. To that end, we request the construction of the tanks and containers necessary for safely storing and transporting these resources to the Moongate Hub.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>11</td><td class="modify">→Interior construction in the Moongate Hub employs the basic materials recommended by our current guidelines. It is problematic, however, to assume that this same standard of structural integrity will suffice once the initiative progresses to unknown─and potentially less hospitable─reaches of the cosmos. We hope to preemptively solve this issue by refitting facilities with materials of greater durability, and request skilled artisans to manufacture replacement partitions and other interior components from sturdy metals.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>12</td><td class="modify">→As the initiative progresses, the scale of inventory management, not to mention the number of people taking up residence on base, continues to expand at a rapid pace. We find ourselves in need of larger storage solutions, as well as general amenities such as benches and lighting equipment. In the case of bulky or complex items, we request that artisans report to us at each stage of the production process.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>13</td><td class="modify">→As we expand the research facilities and living quarters in the Moongate Hub, we are looking for artisans to undertake the larger manufacturing tasks such as water tanks, vaults, and vending machines, as well as crafting spare parts for repairs. Owing to the size of said projects, we will transport the finished product to its intended location using heavy machinery─your only concern should be ensuring the smooth operation of its precision mechanisms.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>14</td><td class="modify">→The new starship we have under construction is the lynchpin of our plans to explore the cosmos. We require artisans to manufacture the hard alloy that will serve as the primary element of its exterior cladding, as well as creating a surplus for repair purposes. As a vessel destined to navigate stellar currents, it must be sturdy enough to withstand the most turbulent aether fluctuations, and the resilient alloy you provide will be further processed into hull plating and other parts as dictated by the starship's unique specifications.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>15</td><td class="modify">→Whether it be on the moon or another star we've yet to explore, our future ground-based expeditions are certain to encounter impassable terrain. Drones have proven useful for transporting supplies, but we are also looking to modify them to perform detailed aerial surveys in regions which challenge our surface vehicles. We encourage artisans to submit a range of parts that we might customize our drones and expand their practical functionality.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>16</td><td class="modify">→On Etheirys and in Mare Lamentorum, there are apparently rare resources whose locations are passed down through folklore. We have discovered that materials of comparable rarity exist in Sinus Ardorum, and wish to use them to advance our initiative. As they are highly difficult to process, great preparation and care must be taken. We will issue a specialized device to assist artisans, but be warned that it has a limited charge.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>17</td><td class="modify">→While metals are indispensable in our quest to explore the cosmos, other materials common to Etheirys are no less vital; leather, cloth, and wood all find use in various essential items such as uniforms and furnishings. To ensure the quality of finished products, we have established exacting specifications for base components we require in quantity, and ask that they be prepared to that standard.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>18</td><td class="modify">→The initiative seeks capable artisans to refine paper and fiber from materials harvested from local flora as well as fauna brought in from northern Ilsabard. Although we primarily store our research data in terminals, we must also prepare physical reports to send to the Studium for archival purposes. That being the case, we require exceptionally durable products that will stand the test of time.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>19</td><td class="modify">→We seek various outfitting materials for the interior of habitation modules and other structures. Although we have been outfitting the living spaces in our recommended fashion, it has come to our attention that the children of man have diverse tastes. With the initiative being a long-term undertaking, we wish to provide a wider selection of materials as part of our commitment to creating a comfortable environment for mission members.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>20</td><td class="modify">→Reports are on the rise of supplies being in shortage at remote work sites. While such occurrences are not critical while our operations are limited to Sinus Ardorum, it could be a matter of life and death when we eventually venture to distant stars. To that end, we are redoubling our efforts to maintain our stockpiles, and kindly ask for contributions of essential items such as medical equipment and heating fuel.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>21</td><td class="modify">→Our researchers have identified new vegetation in Weddingway's Bower that yields useful materials such as fiber and resin. However, an analysis has revealed that there are volatile elements in their composition, and an experienced hand is required in their processing. We seek skilled artisans to test refine the raw materials to determine whether they can be a viable resource for the initiative.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>22</td><td class="modify">→As the final step in determining the viability of materials sourced here in Sinus Ardorum, we must put them to the proof in actual products. These materials have already been confirmed safe, and we now ask our artisans to use them to produce prototypes of items such as tools and clothing. Should these meet our stringent standards, we will move to employ the materials widely in the initiative.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>23</td><td class="modify">→Every day, more people arrive from Etheirys to join the initiative, and this has accelerated the depletion of supplies throughout the Moongate Hub. While most are non-mission-critical items such as cafeteria trays and containers, it would not instill confidence in newcomers if we cannot provide the basics. As such, we ask our artisans to help replenish our stores of daily necessities.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>24</td><td class="modify">→The sky of Etheirys is notable for changing its hue during the course of the day. This phenomenon appears to have a calming effect on people, and in its absence, we fear that initiative members may become prone to illness. In order to ensure everyone's well-being, we wish to improve our rest and relaxation facilities, and ask our artisans to provide comfortable furnishings such as chairs, cushions, and beds.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>25</td><td class="modify">→While the initiative has attracted many artisans from Etheirys, some are struggling more than others to adapt to an unfamiliar work environment. Left to their own devices, they cannot be expected to produce their best, and this will have implications on our productivity. To help our artisans to feel at ease, we seek contributions of furnishings and equipment that will enhance their experience.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>26</td><td class="modify">→As the initiative grows in scale, more mission members are reporting that they lack the necessary tools to carry out their work, or that they must work with tools in poor repair. If this is allowed to continue, it will have a serious impact on efficiency and morale. To ensure that our mission stays on course, we request contributions of equipment, with a focus on those that have been prone to shortage.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>27</td><td class="modify">→As the initiative progresses, certain unanticipated needs have begun to arise. These mainly consist of equipment used in the construction of new facilities along with the related safety gear, and we now turn to our artisans to supply these items to our specifications. As they find use in a wide range of demanding situations, from dizzying heights to deep tunnels, they must be durable as well as versatile in function.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>28</td><td class="modify">→We seek components needed for the facilities due to be built around the Moongate Hub, as well as the Cosmoliner network. As the Cosmoliner will be deployed on other stars following satisfactory testing in Sinus Ardorum, we are looking to stockpile a large amount of components in preparation. In the case of bulky or complex items, we request that artisans report to us at each stage of the production process.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>29</td><td class="modify">→Our researchers have been experiencing a shortage of equipment and materials─the result of oversight on our part. As an impediment to research means an impediment to the initiative as a whole, this must be addressed with all haste. We ask that you fulfill the researchers' requests, which range from small items that are readily prepared to large items that require multiple stages of processing.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>30</td><td class="modify">→In the nations whence our researchers hail, there are apparently places of relaxation called “cafés.” Having conducted research into these establishments, we now seek to improve the rest and relaxation facilities at the Moongate Hub. According to our findings, in addition to certain beverages, furnishings such as bookshelves promote mental well-being, and we ask our artisans to contribute items that have this effect.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>31</td><td class="modify">→In Sinus Ardorum, the transportation of materials is primarily handled by rover, but the rough terrain means that we must package everything carefully to prevent damage. To that end, there is always a need for packaging and related items, which we now ask our artisans to provide. The requirements vary depending on the object to be transported, so please prepare them according to specifications.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>32</td><td class="modify">→On Etheirys and in Mare Lamentorum, there are apparently rare resources whose locations are passed down through folklore. We have discovered that materials of comparable rarity exist in Sinus Ardorum, and wish to use them to advance our initiative.

<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>33</td><td class="modify">→As construction of various facilities in Sinus Ardorum proceeds, demand has increased for bricks to stabilize the foundations of our facilities and lubricant to reduce the wear on metal parts. If we are to meet our schedule, a stable supply of these essentials is of the utmost importance. Looking ahead to further expansion, we have developed a set of standards that all equipment used in the Cosmic Exploration Initiative must follow, and request that all delivered materials meet said standards.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>34</td><td class="modify">→Feedback from our workers has spurred a decision to improve the overall durability of the materials used at our construction sites. Procuring stronger, more versatile mortar and adhesive would ensure that our facilities endure even the harshest conditions. With future expansion of operations in mind, a set of standards has been developed for all materials used by the Cosmic Exploration Initiative. We ask that all deliveries meet said standards and are made with materials which can be found on the lunar surface.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>35</td><td class="modify">→Upon scanning the vital signs of our workers who brave the harsh lunar environment, dodging falling meteorites and eluding toxic spongoi, we have found that some have neglected sleep and food in pursuit of the unknown, giving rise to worrying nutritional imbalances. If this problem is not addressed immediately, we risk a significant deterioration in the health of our most dedicated. We have prepared an ample supply of ingredients and supplements to address this issue, and ask that they be processed into beverages and food that will meet the nutritional needs of our workers.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>36</td><td class="modify">→We have discovered a rare but nutrient-rich fluid within one of the aquatic plants cultivated in the Moongate Hub. Our researchers have suggested using this fluid to assist in the long-term preservation of our food, but first we must have samples of preserved foodstuffs and emergency supplies to evaluate its efficacy. While this fluid may only be the result of an uncommon mutation, we believe the potential applications to be worth exploring. We ask our artisans to provide us with foodstuffs or alchemical agents as their skills apply.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>37</td><td class="modify">→As the initiative continues to gain more workers from Etheirys, we have been faced with a shortage of essential supplies to meet their needs for food, clothing, and shelter. With this in mind, we would like to replenish and expand the variety of items offered in the cafeteria and our habitation modules. Furthermore, as the members of the initiative become more diverse, there is a growing need to store food ingredients in smaller portions to accommodate various dietary preferences. To meet this need, we require storage items such as dishes, pots, and jars.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>38</td><td class="modify">→A new species of aquatic life discovered in Calabash Cove apparently contains multiple beneficial substances. However, the substances have proven extremely delicate, and often degrade during processing. We seek skilled artisans to help us refine a stable method to extract and process these substances, and advise the utmost caution when handling the materials.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>39</td><td class="modify">→In the vastness of the cosmos, none can predict what manner of accidents might occur. Should the unthinkable happen─for instance, if a ship were to stall in a stellar current, leaving it unmoored in the dark void of space─how would we survive? We must prepare for all eventualities, and to that end we mean to stockpile compact, stable, and long-lasting foodstuffs aboard our ship, not to mention carrots of happiness. We ask that all capable artisans deliver rations and beverages fortified with sufficient nutrients.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>40</td><td class="modify">→An analysis of the vegetation in Weddingway's Bower has found that many specimens are exceptionally nutritious. Our researchers have theorized that such plants could be used as a basis for new types of cosmetics and food products─if only someone could solve the problem of the peculiar odor these plants emit. To that end, we shall make all the technology we have available at the disposal of artisans willing to help tackle this conundrum.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>41</td><td class="modify">→Long-term habitation among the stars is unprecedented for most peoples, and among the many unknowns involved is its effect on mental well-being. We believe it a matter that demands careful consideration, and ask that our artisans of varied backgrounds create furnishings and food that evoke familiarity and comfort. Special focus should be placed on promoting mental harmony through aesthetic and olfactory means.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>42</td><td class="modify">→It has come to the initiative's attention that the adventurers in Etheirys employ special foods and tinctures to enhance their abilities prior to engaging in decisive battles or delicate tasks. Having such items at our disposal would certainly help us deal with the various crises which arise in the course of our work. All available artisans are requested to deliver portable foodstuffs and alchemics which will make our workers more efficient.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>43</td><td class="modify">→We have discovered that one of the aquatic organisms raised in the Moongate Hub secretes a fluid rich in nutrients, but have yet to test its effect on the various peoples which work with us. To determine whether this secretion is fit for consumption, the fluid must be processed into an edible form. While the organism in question may be only an anomalous mutation, we believe it has great potential, and recommend processing it into food products or alchemical mixtures.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>44</td><td class="modify">→The initiative has decided to treat our workers to warm meals and fatigue-relieving medicine as a reward for their efforts. Considering our numbers, such an undertaking is no small feat, and requires the preparation of large quantities of product that maintains uniform quality in both effectiveness and flavor. Due to the complexity of the task, we ask that our artisans report to us for evaluation periodically during the course of their work.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>45</td><td class="modify">→While Hydaelyn has blessed us Loporrits with an industriousness that can endure countless centuries, we are still driven by our spirits, and as such our performance fluctuates in relation to our mental well-being. To keep morale high, we request items that will enhance the mood of Loporrit workers. Just as people from Etheirys find comfort in verdant greens and soothing blues, we take solace in ashen greys that remind us of the moon─and of course, anything that tastes like carrots is a delicacy to our palates.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>46</td><td class="modify">→Research into the breeding of aquatic life harvested in Sinus Ardorum proceeds apace, yet we have discovered that the feed on hand is suitable only for wild specimens. While cultivated specimens consume the feed, health scans do not show the expected improvements. We ask that our artisans deliver a mixture that meets the preferences of our cultivated animals, and that its ingredients are sourced from the local environment.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>47</td><td class="modify">→We have received requests from initiative members hailing from Sharlayan to expand the variety of items available in the Moongate Hub's cafeteria. They have expressed a preference for high-energy meals that can be replenished at a moment's notice, and we have made an image of a meal we believe meets these demands. We ask that capable artisans do their utmost to create meals matching this image while using the provided nutritional ingredients.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>48</td><td class="modify">→On Etheirys and in Mare Lamentorum, there are apparently rare resources whose locations are passed down through folklore.

<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>49</td><td class="modify">→Among the material samples collected during the initiative thus far, several have showed promise for further processing. To support ongoing construction, we must ascertain further practical applications of such materials, and ultimately provide project teams with these resources. First, however, we require additional samples to continue our tests.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>50</td><td class="modify">→We seek to boost productivity and ascertain the feasibility of various initiative quotas. Determining the minimum time required to collect a set quantity of resources will provide valuable data for our purposes. Additionally, it is hoped that sharing the times achieved by exceptionally efficient contributors will inspire and motivate all of our project teams.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>51</td><td class="modify">→The ongoing expansion of the Moongate Hub and its ancillary facilities requires a considerable stockpile of materials. As resource-gathering continues across Sinus Ardorum, we must strive towards ever-higher quotas and improved efficiency. Initially, the most expedient way to achieve this is to simply expand our gathering efforts. To this end, we ask all available contributors to assist with material procurement.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>52</td><td class="modify">→We wish to gauge the initiative's resource-collecting capacity by gathering data at a single procurement site and verifying its potential for sustained productivity. Contributors' efforts will be documented via aerial drone, and it is our hope that this visual record will serve as a basis for future efficiency savings and personnel allocation strategies.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>53</td><td class="modify">→Occasionally, reports indicate extraordinary resource collection rates from specific sites. We have determined that in some cases, these high yields are the result of contributors' technical skills and not merely a statistical anomaly. Our intention is to record these individual gathering feats via aerial drone and identify which techniques are the most efficient.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>54</td><td class="modify">→To ensure the continued success of the initiative, it is imperative we conduct a thorough geological survey of Sinus Ardorum. Unused by we Loporrits until now, this crater is still awaiting large-scale investigation. Contributors are requested to obtain material samples that we may accurately measure resource distribution across the moon in its entirety.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>55</td><td class="modify">→Naturally, we strive for quantity when gathering resources, but a discerning eye for quality is equally important. Indeed, it is high-grade materials in particular that make lunar engineering possible. We therefore ask contributors to seek out those carrots in the proverbial haystack, and secure the very best material specimens this moon has to offer.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>56</td><td class="modify">→Thanks to the remarkable efforts of those involved, the Gleamslope interior is now accessible via the Piercingway Tunnel. Preliminary drone scans have identified the area as a potential source of useful raw materials. Based on the visual data received, we now seek to conduct a thorough survey of the sector and obtain samples for further study. It is hoped that this initial foray will underpin future exploration and planning efforts.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>57</td><td class="modify">→With the completion of the nadir lift comes access to the vast cavern known as the lunar nadir. Considering the relative proximity to the moon's core, the area is likely influenced by Zodiark's lingering aetherial residue. Unfortunately, due to the challenging topographical conditions, we are yet to conduct a complete drone scan, and thus seek contributors to survey the area and recover material samples─paying close attention to the quality of any requisitions.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>58</td><td class="modify">→Reports indicate the difficult-to-access northwestern and southeastern fringes of Sinus Ardorum are abundant in rare resources. Researchers have theorized that these mineral deposits are like to be remnants of the meteorite impact that first formed the crater, and therefore highly durable. Indeed, samples gleaned thus far have proven this without exception. Given the value of such resources in starship construction and other engineering works, we request the swift recovery of high quality materials from these areas.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>59</td><td class="modify">→In addition to primary construction materials, Sinus Ardorum is awash with resources utilized in a number of fabrication processes that are essential to our future interstellar endeavors. To ensure we have a sufficient stockpile, contributors are asked to gather resources and keep an eye out for materials of exceptional quality in particular.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>60</td><td class="modify">→Owing to its ready accessibility, the area surrounding the Moongate Hub is favored as a material collection point. As the initiative progresses, however, over-reliance on this sector will likely have a detrimental impact on the environment. To avoid this, we must determine current resource levels in the area and assess the gathering potential of newly established sites, that we might more evenly distribute our resource gathering. A range of samples from different sites will aid in this endeavor.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>61</td><td class="modify">→Powering operations across Sinus Ardorum, the energization station is vital to the success of our initiative. Crucially, it frees us from reliance on the aetheric energy bestowed by Hydaelyn that sustains Bestways Burrow. In order to maintain and expand our existing energy infrastructure, thus guaranteeing continued self-sufficiency, we seek contributors to gather the necessary resources.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>62</td><td class="modify">→Here in Sinus Ardorum, a steady water supply ensures the survival of our ever-thirsty Etheirys-born contributors, and supports ongoing aquatic cultivation. The hydrofication station in particular is key to maintaining water purity, and routine replacement of its filtration system is critical. To this end, we require a plentiful stockpile of the materials required for filter fabrication.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>63</td><td class="modify">→It is imperative we care for the environment wherever the initiative takes us. With the goal of reducing any negative impacts of our operations in Sinus Ardorum, we have installed air filters on much of our infrastructure─from mini rover exhausts to the circulation systems used throughout the Moongate Hub. Filters require a catalyst to function, and to ensure maximum efficiency, these must be fabricated using locally sourced materials. Contributors are requested to aid us in acquiring the necessary resources.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>64</td><td class="modify">→According to geological surveys, Sinus Ardorum is home to materials comparable in rarity to those recorded in the folklore of Etheirys. Needless to say, acquiring such rarities would benefit our initiative considerably. Locating and gathering these resources will likely be difficult, and therefore require sufficient preparation and a diligent approach. Nonetheless, we deem such activities a key determinant for our future success.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>65</td><td class="modify">→With the aid of Sharlayan researchers, we have released aquatic life native to Etheirys into decontaminated springs in Sinus Ardorum. Through aquacultural experimentation on the moon, we aim to increase sources of sustenance for our interstellar travels. Some time has passed since experimentation began, and it is imperative that the state of our lunar aquaculture be reviewed at regular intervals. As such, a sufficient sample size of various specimens is requested.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>66</td><td class="modify">→Though all lunar springs were initially tainted with aetherochemicals, there are now a number of purified pools owing to the rainbow crystal's cleansing capabilites. Yet what became of the remnant unpurified waters, and what effect─if any─has our development of the surroundings had on them?
