For her, it represents the culmination of years of rebellion, and marks the end of an era for Oblivion itself. Triumphs aside, Krile wonders if you have seen the last of the troubles arising from the key. The Scion leaves you with that unsettling thought as she heads off to her meeting with G'raha Tia and the city officials. Shale, too, returns to her own waiting tasks, but not before inviting you to rest in the Backroom while you watch over Alexandria's return to normalcy.</td></tr>

In the weeks that pass, Oblivion uncovers several Preservation facilities and makes a comprehensive study of regulator function. This leads to the understanding that memories of the deceased were never truly erased, merely locked away, and that this process can be reversed by sending a signal from the Meso Terminal.

Acting at the government's behest, your party and Sphene escort Gossan to Living Memory, where a much-recovered Wuk Lamat makes a surprise appearance. Together, you reactivate the terminals, and restore the memories of those who consented. The reaction in Alexandria is immediate and bittersweet, with many bursting into tears at the sudden flood of long-lost remembrances.

Gossan is grateful for your actions, and responds to Sphene's request to remain in Alexandria with an unexpected demand of his own: it seems that, inspired by the gentle leadership she displayed when despair held the kingdom in thrall, the people have insisted that she take her rightful place as their monarch. After much flustered deliberation, Sphene accepts the role, declaring peace and prosperity for Alexandria as her foremost purpose. Thus do you stand witness to the rise of a new Queen of Reason.</td></tr>

After showing enthusiastic support for her nephew's ambition to learn swordplay, Wuk Lamat turns her attention to you. She expresses joy at how events unfolded for the queens past and present, and thanks you for helping her fulfill her promise. Erenville, meanwhile, speaks of an impending extended journey, and Koana declares his intent to compile a thorough account of Tuliyollan history even as he attends to his day-to-day administrative duties. With plans shared and assurances to reunite exchanged, they send you on your way back to Sphene and the other Scions.</td></tr>

Her citizens, too, have elected to face their grief with courage─the precious memories they have reclaimed serving to guide and sustain them through the days to come. Whether you are staying to investigate Preservation's mysteries, or departing to seek distant adventures, the soon-to-be-crowned Queen of Reason offers you all, her cherished comrades, the eternal hospitality of the nation you so valiantly saved.</td></tr>
