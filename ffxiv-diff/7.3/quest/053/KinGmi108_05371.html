As Calyx mocks your efforts, the air grows heavy, the weight of mortal dread once more pressing down upon you. In a dry, academic tone, Calyx explains that the experience of death has only strengthened his creation─that it will rise, again and again, until the lightning aether suffusing his ravaged world is drained to its last spark. However, his promise of enduring memories prompts Sphene to recall the true meaning of those words and the comfort they were meant to offer. With Shale's help, she broadcasts a message of hope across Alexandria, buoying the citizens and interrupting the flow of prayer to the primal. Taking advantage of its momentary weakness, your party divides its efforts, with one half battling the entity, and the other working to bring down the barrier protecting the device. Wuk Lamat and Sphene's combined attack finally shatters the energy shield, while Alisaie delivers the killing blow to your enfeebled enemy. Calyx can only monitor the progress of his memory transfer in silent desperation as you spring into action, your decisive strike causing the memory bank to erupt in a spectacular explosion. In the wake of this destruction, Calyx has winked out of existence, and an exhausted Wuk Lamat collapses to the ground, her promise fulfilled.</td></tr>
