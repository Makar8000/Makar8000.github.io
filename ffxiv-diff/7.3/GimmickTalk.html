<tr><td></td><td>46</td><td>4</td><td>False</td><td>Indecipherable tomes are strewn across the floor and piled haphazardly among the fallen shelves. Closer inspection reveals countless magical glyphs, likely representing a wealth of arcane knowledge.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>47</td><td class="modify">0→4</td><td class="modify">False→True</td><td class="modify">→You come across all sorts of head-scratchers walking the streets of San d'Oria, but none more puzzling than the so-called rivalry between Gallijaux and his brother Joulet.

They're said to be locked in a contest to see who can catch the most carp, yet every day without fail, adventurers show up hauling in barrels of carp on their behalf. Doesn't sound like much of a fishing competition to me, yet no one seems to question it.
Stranger still is the poor compensation offered for these deliveries. You'd fetch a far better price at the auction house, and yet the stream of adventurers to the pier never dries up. Maybe they know something the rest of us don't. Maybe there's a greater prize waiting at the end of it all.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>48</td><td class="modify">0→4</td><td class="modify">False→True</td><td class="modify">→It feels like little more than an old wives' tale now, but rumor has it a strange, giant creature is known to appear in these parts. There are written reports of sightings in the area, but they're all so wildly different, it's difficult to separate fact from fiction. Some say adventurers swarm the beast and fell it in a flash. Others claim there's no great beast at all—only a grand culling of the local fauna.
The only common thread in every account is that those in attendance have a grand time. A tale more jovial than cautionary, if you ask me.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>49</td><td class="modify">0→4</td><td class="modify">False→True</td><td class="modify">→Another day, another failed attempt... Would that it didn't cost so many seals.
Still, I suppose “failed” isn't the right word. We did win, after all.
I'll get what I'm after eventually. For now, it's time to head home and clear my head.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>50</td><td class="modify">0→4</td><td class="modify">False→True</td><td class="modify">→Worms today, crabs tomorrow, and the day after that? Leeches, maybe?
Ugh, but those kisses, and that strength-sapping mist... I &lt;Emphasis&gt;really&lt;/Emphasis&gt; can't stand that one.
Maybe it's time for a change of scenery. Rolanberry Fields could be worth a look. Demand on the market's always changing, after all. No reason why our choice of hunting grounds shouldn't either.
Takes a lot of planning, but that's half the fun of being a linkshell master.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>51</td><td class="modify">0→4</td><td class="modify">False→True</td><td class="modify">→Long, long ago, there was once a great civilization that flourished in the firmament. But their leaders, in pursuit of paradise eternal, dared to trespass upon the forbidden.
This would bring ruin to their civilization, its leaders falling into slumber that would last an age.
Yet we must not forget, their spirits are undying. Even now, they refuse to abandon their dreams of paradise.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>52</td><td>4</td><td>True</td><td>What is Preservation's purpose? The answer to that question is simple: to ensure the survival of mankind. In a world beset by lightning-aspected imbalance, this means securing a place where people may live in safety, as well as establishing a treatment for the levin sickness which plagues us.
Many approaches were considered, but in the end, it was a child─a youth of undeniable genius─who discovered the most brilliant and complete solution to all the challenges we now face.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>53</td><td>4</td><td>True</td><td>According to Master Calyx, it is not the body which provides life to a living being, but the soul. Furthermore, it is the memories etched upon that ephemeral giver of existence which encapsulate one's true self. Based upon these principles, he has proposed a methodology for preserving souls using electrope technology─as souls are composed entirely of aether, he asserts that storage via contemporary means should be eminently possible.
Experiments conducted on criminal subjects and volunteers have, in fact, already proven successful in capturing the aether released at the moment of death. Mankind as we know it has taken a great leap forward.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>54</td><td>4</td><td>True</td><td>We have succeeded in transferring a soul stored within a specialized electrope device into a mechanical soldier, resulting in full control and function. No longer need we fear the erosion which lightning energies inflict upon flesh-and-blood bodies. Yet despite this crucial breakthrough, Master Calyx remains unsatisfied. He would divorce memory from soul, siphoning the soul's aether reserves whilst granting eternal life to the individual's memories. Unfettered to a soul, memories can not only be stored, but also backed up as data─the Endless will be beings of pure information.
His foreshortened lifespan was, perhaps, the very perspective needed to conceive of such a unique evolutionary path.</td></tr>
