When the balance of aether collapsed in the Ninth, only the Kingdom of Alexandria was fortunate enough to survive the calamity. Nevertheless, it suffered tremendous devastation, with great swathes of its territory submerged by endless rains.

Against this dire backdrop, a collective of scientists known as Preservation announced a plan to build a great tower over the royal palace, within which survivors might take shelter from the rising waters. It was a project of unprecedented scale, but through the extensive and innovative use of electrope, what was thought impossible became possible. Over the following centuries, additional elements were added to the structure, with sectors for primary and secondary industries constructed beside residential areas, until it grew into its present form, with all the facilities needed not only for people to survive, but to thrive.

Eventually, life within Everkeep became so advanced that the populace could enjoy indulgences like an amusement park, which was opened on the uppermost level. Later, however, when the method for recreating the departed from preserved memories was perfected, the park was renamed Living Memory and repurposed as a home for the Endless. This level alone remained in the Ninth when interdimensional fusion was employed to join Alexandria to the Source.→Dominating the skies above the enclosed portion of Yyasulani, this colossal twelve-level tower rises from the heart of Heritage Found.

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>158</td><td>A resistance organization first established during the time of old Alexandria. Its founders were Krile's birth parents, Robor and Alayla, former members of Preservation who opposed Calyx's plan to invade other worlds. Once the then-infant Krile was targeted for experimentation, the researcher couple seized the key to interdimensional fusion and used it to deliver both the artifact and their child to the Source to keep them safe from the enemy. They vanished from record thereafter, with their Endless incarnations later encountered in Living Memory.

Deprived of their founders, Oblivion effectively ceased to be─until decades later when its secret headquarters, now known as the Backroom, was discovered by Cahciua and her followers. Although detailed information pertaining to the key had been erased, Cahciua, strongly believing in Oblivion's purpose, reestablished the organization under its original name. With the Yyasulani native at the helm, its members set out to thwart King of Resolve Zoraal Ja's ambitions for conquest.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>160</td><td>Regulator</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>161</td><td>An electrope device issued to citizens of Alexandria, the regulator boasts various remarkable capabilities. Chief among them is the ability to resurrect the wearer by imbuing them with life force extracted from other souls in the event of unanticipated death. This has allowed the people to live out the span of their natural lives, provided they have sufficient surplus souls. By way of a similar mechanism, souls can also be harnessed to temporarily enhance one's physical prowess, this usage being common among those in dangerous occupations such as soldiers, hunters, and arena fighters.

Additionally, regulators have the ability to manipulate the wearer's memories, a function that served twofold purposes: to remove all memories pertaining to death, thereby sparing Alexandrians the fear of mortality, and to preserve the memories of the departed as data. This data would thence be used in the creation of an Endless version of the individual.

Such a powerful and ubiquitous device, however, could be misused by those with influence. This was made evident with the neo regulators, whose adoption Calyx encouraged by having the simulant, an impostor of the fallen Queen of Reason, declare that only their wearers could become Endless. By concurrently limiting the device's availability, Calyx cultivated heightened terror towards death among the populace─terror which he exploited to manifest the dread primal Necron.

Following Calyx's defeat, the government of Alexandria took steps to unlock the memories of the departed within citizens who so desired. What regulators have taken away, regulators shall restore.</td></tr>
