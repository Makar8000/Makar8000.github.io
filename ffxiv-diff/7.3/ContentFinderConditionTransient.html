<tr><td></td><td>1027</td><td>In the waning days of the old kingdom, the people of Alexandria sought a way to survive as their home sank beneath the earth. They built a towering structure that enveloped the royal castle itself, and as the long years came and went, Everkeep grew to soaring heights. Yet some whisper that the castle has withstood the ravages of time, and in the city's foundation endures as a symbol of bygone glory. From within those timeworn depths Calyx sends his transmissions, and you must delve into Alexandria's past to ascertain their source.</td></tr>

A monument to the existence of the Alexandrian people, as well as a resting place for their memories, it is within this soaring spire that Calyx maintains his stronghold.

The self-proclaimed architect of mankind's evolution has invited you to confront him in the upper reaches of the terminal─an invitation you must accept lest his atrocities continue to escalate. Step into the structure's glowing interior, and begin your wary ascent through the midst of the dreaming Endless...</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>1030</td><td>Calyx's trail has led you to Alexandria's castle and into a wicked trap. Seeking to take more precise measurements of your strength, Calyx pits you against a mechanical guardian forged from Sphene's memories of Zelenia, the second-in-command of the royal knights. The queen implores you to lay this affront to her dear friend's honor to rest. Make ready to test your mettle against one of Alexandria's finest blades!</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>1031</td><td>Once more the wandering minstrel weaves a tale with his musical talents, this time an ode to a stalwart knight who served with distinction beneath thunderous skies. With peerless skills and formidable magicks she defended the throne, yet as the queen was barred from the battlefield, she never spied Zelenia's cold, merciless gaze, nor glimpsed the raging fury that burned within her breast. What would this simulacrum born of the queen's memories become had Sphene possessed firsthand knowledge of the warrior's unbridled ferocity? As the ballad fills your ears, a vision of this daunting foe begins to take shape...</td></tr>
