<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1108</td><td>During party combat, if you find that the enemies are swarming you instead of the tank, you may wish to withhold your attacks until the tank has regained enmity.

■ Tank Stance
Each tank job has a special action that helps to keep their enmity level high.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1109</td><td>With tank stance active, attacks dealt to enemies will generate significantly higher enmity, controlling the focus of enemy attacks and thereby helping to keep allies safe. This is a key aspect of playing as a tank in party combat.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1110</td><td>Enhancements and Enfeeblements</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1111</td><td>An enhancement is a status effect that strengthens the player, whereas an enfeeblement is one that weakens the player. The icons for enhancements and enfeeblements you receive will appear in the Status Effects element of your HUD layout.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1112</td><td>Enhancements have icons shaped like upward arrows, whereas enfeeblements are shaped like downward arrows. A white line across the top of the icon indicates that the enfeeblement can be removed with certain healing actions such as Esuna.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1115</td><td>This marker indicates that you have been targeted with some manner of attack.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1116</td><td>The specifics of the ensuing attack will vary depending on the enemy and/or duty, but in all cases, it will involve you in some way.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1117</td><td>Area of Effect Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1118</td><td>This marker indicates that you have been targeted with an area of effect attack. Targeted players should move away from their allies, and vice versa.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1119</td><td>Stack Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1120</td><td>This marker indicates that a powerful area of effect attack is imminent. As a stack marker is all but impossible to survive alone, it is imperative that the targeted player stand with as many allies as possible to divide the damage evenly.

Note that there are two different types of stack marker:

■ Circle Stack</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1121</td><td>■ Line Stack</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1122</td><td>Lethal Attack Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1123</td><td>This marker warns of an incredibly powerful attack. Typically, it targets the player with the most enmity, and because it deals tremendous damage, most non-tank jobs are unlikely to survive it.

Should you be targeted, your defensive abilities can help keep you safe. For example, tanks can use Rampart to lower damage sustained as well as Reprisal to lower enemy damage output. For all other roles, check the Actions &amp; Traits menu to see which defensive abilities your job can learn.

Note that there are a few different markers, each with different areas of effect:</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1124</td><td>■ Solo Marker
Depending on the enemy, these may inflict an area of effect attack.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1125</td><td>■ Area of Effect Marker</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1126</td><td>■ Line / Cleave Marker
These attacks will strike the entire area behind the target.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1127</td><td>■ Stack Marker
The spheres orbiting the center indicate how many players are needed to withstand the attack.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1128</td><td>Homing Area of Effect Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1129</td><td>This marker indicates that you will be chased by a series of area of effect attacks targeting your current location.

Because these attacks will strike rapidly and repeatedly, the best course of action is to stay on the move, away from your allies.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1130</td><td>Knockback Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1131</td><td>This marker indicates that a knockback attack is imminent. When it strikes, you will be pushed a set distance away from the point of impact based on your relative location. Keep this in mind and either position yourself accordingly or use an action that nullifies knockback effects.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1132</td><td>Note that there are different types of knockback:

■ Radial Knockback
Players will be pushed outwards from the point of impact. If the marker is purple, like this one, it cannot be nullified by job actions.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1133</td><td>■ Directional Knockback
Players will be pushed in a single set direction.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1134</td><td>Area of Effect Knockback Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1135</td><td>This area of effect marker has an accompanying knockback effect. When it strikes, you will be pushed a set distance away from the point of impact based on your relative location. You will take damage if you stand inside its bounds, so you should position yourself along its outer edges.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1136</td><td>If the marker is purple, like this one, it cannot be nullified by job actions.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1137</td><td>Flare Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1138</td><td>This marker indicates that a proximity-based area of effect attack is imminent. The closer you stand to its point of impact, the more damage you will take, so retreat as far as you can.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1139</td><td>Sometimes these proximity attacks will target a specific player. To minimize damage, the target should move away from the rest of their party, and vice versa. </td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1140</td><td>Tower Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1141</td><td>This marker indicates that a tower attack is imminent. If left unoccupied by at least one player, the entire party will take significant damage.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1142</td><td>Note that there are different tower markers with different effects:

■ Tank Tower
This type of tower hits especially hard. Only a tank should occupy it.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1143</td><td>■ Multi-player Towers
Some towers require a specific number of players to fully absorb the attack. This number will be indicated by the marker. Displayed below are two examples of two-player towers.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1144</td><td>Proximity Tether Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1145</td><td>This spiky marker indicates that you have been tethered to a hostile force. Remain in close proximity and you will receive some manner of negative effect, be it damage or an enfeeblement.

Fortunately, this type of tether can be negated by moving away until the spikes disappear, like so:</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1146</td><td>Another type of proximity tether, also known as a chain, will continuously damage both players to whom it is connected so long as they remain in close proximity of one another. Affected players can break this tether by moving away from each other.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1147</td><td>Interceptible Tether Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1148</td><td>This marker indicates that an attack will strike the current target. Depending on the situation, it may be necessary for a player to intercept it by physically blocking it from its target.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1149</td><td>Gaze Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1150</td><td>This marker indicates that a gaze attack is imminent. Any player facing the enemy when this attack strikes will receive some manner of negative effect. Alternatively, sometimes the gaze marker will originate from a player instead.

In both cases, it can be negated by facing away from its source before the attack strikes.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1151</td><td>Other Markers</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1152</td><td>Here you will find descriptions of other attack markers encountered in combat.

■ Number Markers
These markers indicate the order in which players will be attacked, starting with the player whose marker has the fewest orbs.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1153</td><td>■ Multi-player Markers
This marker indicates the number of players who must stand together to survive the attack, as shown by the number of orbs.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1154</td><td>■ Countdown Markers
These markers count down to an imminent attack, and if you are caught doing a forbidden action when it reaches zero, you will be penalized with damage or an enfeeblement.

All countdown markers serve the same function regardless of enemy or duty, and over time you will learn the forbidden actions typically associated with each one.</td></tr>
