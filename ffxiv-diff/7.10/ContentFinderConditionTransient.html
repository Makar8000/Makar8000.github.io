Revisit now your grueling encounter with the mighty auspice, and fight to lift the dark cloud that shrouds his heart ere you are overcome by his heavenly gales...</td></tr>

Zoraal Ja himself led the Landsguard in an effort to quell the beast's boundless fury, yet while the First Promise returned in triumph, few know what became of the village and its people. In your search for clues as to the identity of Gulool Ja's mother, you learn that Zoraal Ja visited the region many times over the years, and that it may be home to a secret research facility. And so you and yours attempt to retrace the King of Resolve's steps and unearth a buried past...</td></tr>

After an armor-clad stranger was found unconscious in the Skydeep Cenote, bereft of memory, the shade of Gulool Ja Ja was spotted stalking the woods with a young girl. What appeared to be unrelated events take a turn when Bakool Ja Ja confronts the Dawnservant's shadowy impostor. The armor-clad stranger recognizes the girl as Prishe, a friend seemingly turned enemy, who retreats with Gulool Ja Ja's shade into the blinding light of an otherworldly rift. In search of answers, and to safeguard Tural, Bakool Ja Ja bids you join him as he follows the incongruous pair into the unknown.</td></tr>

Helpless to defy the purpose she was given, this simulacrum sought to preserve the memories of her subjects by taking the lives of innocents in other reflections. Though she met her end by your hands, had she been further along her ill-fated path by the time of your confrontation, might she have proven unstoppable and gone on to wreak untold death and devastation? Such questions play on your mind as the minstrel's verse bears you away to a world of the imagination, where you once again come face-to-face with the dread entity known as Queen Eternal...</td></tr>
