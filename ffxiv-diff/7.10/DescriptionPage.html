After a Series ends, a new one will begin, and available rewards will change accordingly─though rewards earned during one Series can still be claimed until the next has finished. Make sure to check your Series level and claim any earned rewards via the PvP Profile!

When you win a ranked match, you will gain one Rising Star. Similarly, a loss will remove one Star. Once you have earned the maximum three Rising Stars in one riser, an additional win will allow you to move up a riser. Winning three or more matches in a row while in the Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Diamond tier will apply a streak bonus, netting you two Rising Stars per win.

Once you have reached Crystal, the highest tier, victory and defeat will be reflected by your Crystal Credit, rather than Rising Stars. The amount of Credit you earn or forfeit in matches is determined by the difference in average Credit between your team and the opposing team. Streak bonuses do not apply to Crystal Credit.

There are two ways to check your current enmity level:

①The Enmity List
The enmity list shows all enemies with whom you have generated enmity. The icon on the left indicates your current enmity level. The four levels are displayed below in order of greatest to least.</td><td></td><td>②The Party List
The party list shows each party member's enmity level with the currently selected enemy, as indicated in the lower left corner of the class/job icon.

The player with the greatest enmity is marked with A, followed by 2, 3, and so on. The adjacent gauge shows the relative difference in enmity compared to the player with the most.</td><td></td><td>During party combat, if you find that the enemies are swarming you instead of the tank, you may wish to withhold your attacks until the tank has regained enmity.

■ Tank Stance
Each tank job has a special action that helps to keep their enmity level high.</td><td></td><td>With tank stance active, attacks dealt to enemies will generate significantly higher enmity, controlling the focus of enemy attacks and thereby helping to keep allies safe. This is a key aspect of playing as a tank in party combat.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td></tr>
