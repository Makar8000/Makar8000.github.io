Zero's mother, a memoriate, was with child when she was exposed to a powerful source of Darkness during battle. Zero was thus born half-voidsent, and ceased to age after reaching adulthood. She chose to take up her mother's struggle to bring an end to the Contramemoria, but while traveling as a lone hero, she was bested by a band of corrupt memoriates. The Flood of Darkness inundated the world even as she lay dying, sweeping her soul into the rift between worlds.

When an incidental fissure at last allowed her to return, she found her world an empty void, uninhabitable by any being that was not a voidsent. Zero surrendered to hopelessness, condemned as she was to wander alone for eternity.

Although strong enough to manifest her own territory in the swirling mire, Zero rarely visited her “home” unless her aether reserves were low. It instead became a sanctuary for lesser voidsent who had grown tired of the endless battle for dominance─an intrusion she tolerated without protest.

Seeking an advantage against the Warrior of Light, it was Zenos who summoned Zero to the Source and bound her to serve as his reaper avatar. With his defeat, she was cast back unto the void, where she would once again encounter Eorzea's champion and their companions when they came in search of the great wyrm Azdaja. They gave her the name “Zero,” and struck a bargain to enlist her aid in their battle against Golbez's archfiends. As they traveled and fought together, Zero began to reconnect with a part of herself she had thought forever lost, and the discovery of how Light might be restored to her world rekindled a fire within her breast. Zero soon abandoned the pretense of payment and accompanied the Warrior of Light of her own accord, forging bonds of friendship with Jullus and many others in a way that she had shunned when fighting alone.

The quest to defeat Zeromus would eventually take her to the First to meet with Ryne, the Oracle of Light. Ryne's words gave Zero much to consider, and after contemplating what her half-voidsent nature allowed her to do that no other being could, she took within herself the power of Light.

Zero then returned to the Void to confront Golbez in the depths of the moon. Golbez, too, had desired to restore the Thirteenth, but in his grief at losing his dear companion, he had been manipulated by the Ascians into unleashing the Flood of Darkness. So it was that Zero revealed to him the flicker of Light she carried, convincing the would-be conqueror that a seed of hope yet remained. During the ensuing battle with Zeromus, Zero's fervent wish to save her world transformed her into a knight of legendary appearance. A blow infused with both Light and Darkness shattered Zeromus's form, and Zero succeeded in sealing the massive voidsent's aether in memoria. Following their triumph, she joined hands with the repentant Golbez, and together they took the first steps toward bringing Light into the void.

Wary of diluting her essence, Zero has always avoided feeding on the souls of others. This insistence on consuming stray aether often led to her death through starvation, leaving her to drift in the void until her corporeal form was reconstituted. After not eating physically for so long, Zero's sense of taste had also atrophied─but she has since rediscovered this facet of cuisine after sampling heavily spiced foods in the Source. The extremely spicy curry custom-made to her preference in Radz-at-Hahn has become one of the city's new signature dishes.→In the void, where life's natural cycle no longer holds sway, Zero strives to restore her world to its rightful state.

<tr><td></td><td>136</td><td>Within all beings─whether it be man, animal, or even plant─does aether flow. It is the spark which grants life to the lifeless. Conversely, death can be said to occur once aether has left a corporeal object. From this it is clear to see why many scholars use the words 'life' and 'aether' interchangeably.

The aether of the living can be broadly divided into corporeal aether─one's vigor or life force; and incorporeal aether─more colloquially known as one's soul. A person possessed of only the former becomes a zombie, while having only the latter would render them a ghost.

Aetherologists also assert that an individual's “memory” is inscribed upon their soul's aether. It is further theorized that memories associated with stronger emotions, such as regret, are more likely to persist after death, which would perhaps explain why so many spirits fixate upon vengeance.

When a living creature perishes, its corporeal aether remains in the physical world where it is consumed by predators or absorbed back into the land to provide nourishment for other life-forms. Incorporeal aether, however, is returned to the aetherial sea. In that otherworldly plane is a soul washed clean of its memories, there to await rebirth as a new entity.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>140</td><td>The foremost feature of his striking appearance, Gulool Ja Ja's two heads are a characteristic unique to the Mamool Ja's “blessed siblings”─rare individuals born of a union between the brown-scaled Hoobigo and the blue-scaled Boonewa.

These two-headed marvels inherit both the Hoobigo's robust strength and the Boonewa's arcane affinity, maturing into warriors of unrivaled martial prowess. The Mamool Ja have previously sought to force this miracle, desiring advantage in their historical conflict against the Xbr'aal, but the commingling of the Hoobigo and Boonewa lines was fraught with complications: for every healthy blessed sibling born, a hundred infants failed to survive.

Before Gulool Ja Ja's feet, too, were set firmly on the path of war, he was fortunate to encounter the Eorzean explorer, Ketenramm. The friendship he forged with the outsider opened his eyes to the world beyond the forest, encouraging him to depart Mamook and its restrictive traditions. He traveled far and wide across the lands of Tural, meeting its diverse races and cultivating new companions along the way. His was a tale of unprecedented adventures, which culminated in the defeat and imprisonment of Valigarmanda, the Skyruin.

Following these accomplishments, Gulool Ja Ja returned to Yak T'el with his comrades in tow, whereupon they challenged the warring Mamool Ja and Xbr'aal forces. The two-head's fellowship thoroughly humbled both armies, leading to a cessation of hostilities and a lasting peace.

Word of Valigarmanda's defeat and the end of the Yak T'el war spread swiftly to every corner of the continent. The philosophy of cooperation espoused by Gulool Ja Ja begat a rising tide of like-minded sentiment, paving the way for the foundation of Tuliyollal and elevating him to the position of “Dawnservant.” As the new nation's ruler, his bold and ebullient right head would lead their armies as the Vow of Resolve, whilst his wise and benevolent left head would govern their myriad peoples as the Vow of Reason. Under this balanced leadership did he henceforth guide the fledgling federation into a state of great prosperity.

As a two-headed Mamool Ja, Gulool Ja Ja was thought incapable of siring children. Some decades after his ascension to the throne, however, the Dawnservant was blessed with the arrival of a son: Zoraal Ja. And as if precipitated by this unprecedented event, Gulool Ja Ja went on to adopt the orphaned Koana and Wuk Lamat, one promptly after the other. With the royal family thus expanded, the Dawnservant turned his hand to raising his heirs─the First, Second, and Third Promises.

Yet even the greatest of potentates cannot outrun old age forever. Unwilling to allow his inevitable passing to plunge the nation into chaos, Gulool Ja Ja took inspiration from the old ways of Mamook to devise a rite of succession. He watched over Wuk Lamat and Koana as they became joint rulers of Tuliyollal, and it was during the ascension ceremony that he confirmed their suspicions: the constantly slumbering Head of Reason had passed quietly from this world some three years before.

Gulool Ja Ja's saga came to a tragic end when soldiers of Alexandria later attacked the capital. The former Dawnservant faced off against the invasion force's commander─his own son, Zoraal Ja─in single combat, seemingly defeating the treacherous Promise. Using regulator technology, however, Zoraal Ja arose stronger than before and slew his father in cold blood.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>143</td><td>Comprised of two great landmasses─Xak Tural, the northern lands of the Father, and Yok Tural, the southern lands of the Mother─the continent of the “New World” lies far to the west of Eorzea's shores.

Its many and diverse peoples spent centuries mired in territorial wars until the epic deeds of Gulool Ja Ja and his dream of Tuliyollal saw them united under the banner of a single nation some eighty years ago.

This age of peace would endure until the unquiet days which followed the rite of succession. Scarcely had Wuk Lamat and Koana ascended the throne when the new Vows were faced with an unusual crisis─the abrupt appearance of an enormous dome of energy over Yyasulani. It was then that a mechanical army led by Zoraal Ja, the true son of the former Dawnservant, emerged from the glowing structure, and launched an assault upon the capital of Tuliyollal.

Upon investigation, the dome was found to contain a fraction of a shard world fused with the local region. The reflection's partial rejoining caused a temporal anomaly, its nature such that while mere moments had passed outside, those trapped within had lived through thirty years. During those lost decades, Queen Sphene, ruler of the dome's people, joined hands with Zoraal Ja. Together they built the kingdom of Alexandria anew, and in a bid to plunder aether from other worlds, orchestrated the invasion which brought such panic and destruction to Tural.

Although the Warrior of Light was able to aid the newly ascended Dawnservants in defeating the immediate threat, the dome itself persists─as do the issues surrounding the repatriation of those native to Yyasulani.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>146</td><td>The rite of succession was a contest held by Tuliyollal's first Dawnservant, Gulool Ja Ja, to determine a worthy successor to his throne.

He permitted four candidates to participate in the rite: his firstborn son, Zoraal Ja; his adopted children, Koana and Wuk Lamat; and the winner of the grand melee tournament, the two-headed Bakool Ja Ja, who was the only competitor not part of the royal family.

The conditions for victory required the hopefuls to find the legendary city of gold. Breaking the seal the Dawnservant had placed at its entrance, however, would require the acquisition of seven keystones, which could only be earned by retracing the steps Gulool Ja Ja once walked to unite Tural's peoples. Along the way, the candidates would encounter seven electors, each waiting to award a keystone to those who performed a chosen feat to their satisfaction.

On the surface, this overwrought process seemed designed solely to indulge Gulool Ja Ja's love of competition, but it served a deeper purpose. By forcing the candidates to interact with the electors─also elders of the various clans─the Dawnservant hoped to impart a greater understanding of Tuliyollal's diverse cultures and history, and in so doing cultivate a fitting heir to his title.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>149</td><td>A tural vidraal is a rare example of when a creature of advanced age evolves far beyond the usual limits of its species. Meaning “land grasper” in the common tongue, the term well describes how the monstrous power of these entities comes to dominate the region in which they dwell.

The existence of several tural vidraal have been recorded to date, but even among these anomalies, the infamous Valigarmanda was unrivaled in strength. It was dubbed the “Skyruin,” a name earned for the destruction it visited upon Tural every time it stirred from slumber. Valigarmanda's reign of terror continued until eight decades past, when Gulool Ja Ja and his company of heroes subdued the beast and sealed it within the Yok Huy temple of Karryorzar the Gracious.

The Skyruin awakened one last time during the rite of succession, its prison of ice unmade by the reckless actions of Bakool Ja Ja. Fortunately for the region's inhabitants, the Mamool Ja's rival candidates and their champions rose to the challenge. Upon the field of battle did they come together to slay the scourge of Urqopacha, and write the final chapter to its legend.</td></tr>
