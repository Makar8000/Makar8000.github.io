The knowledge was kept secret, passed down to those who would inherit the position of master dollmaker. That is, until one man chose to break with tradition.

He claimed to be leaving on a journey in pursuit of an “unparalleled beauty,” but we never learned the truth of it. The only thing that is certain, is the art of our forebears left with him.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>92</td><td>An entity which appears to be─for lack of a better term─a walking chimney guards the doors leading into the ruins. The doors themselves possess a design wholly unfamiliar to me, and I cannot help but feel we are on the verge of discovering something incredible.
Alas, the pain from the needle which pierced my lower back worsens... What's more, the arm of one of my guards is paralyzed, leaving him incapable of lifting his sword. We cannot hope to face that &lt;Emphasis&gt;thing&lt;/Emphasis&gt; in this state. Though my heart breaks, we've no recourse but to withdraw.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>93</td><td>While His Majesty Zoraal Ja is not the first to conceive of transferring a beast's soul into a person's body, safety and ethical concerns have ensured no earnest attempts have been made to date. Yet our king believes that there is no greater evil than to hinder the potential of man, and so he has ordered us to make this conception a reality. He would bolster our military might and break through into the outside world. If our research will further this ambition, then perhaps it is worth pursuing.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>94</td><td>Our bodies are fragile vessels. Although the infusion of another person's soul confers strength and vitality, the soul of a beast yields mixed results. Even when stripped of memories, a feral soul can induce psychological instability in the subject. I suspect this is because primal instincts remain. And while a certain amount of bestial ferocity is expected─and I daresay, welcomed─too many such souls can lead to physical mutations. For now, our objective shall be to determine the threshold beyond which a body is at risk of uncontrolled mutation.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>95</td><td>The rate of transfiguration may be dictated by the potency of the soul consumed. We've experimented with fiends of great power, but mutations were observed after the infusion of merely a single soul. No better was this phenomenon illustrated than with poor Atticus. His body was altered irreparably, and he lost all capacity for rational thought. While the primary objective of this research was to utilize the soul of a tural vidraal, I struggle to see a path forward. An alternative approach must be considered.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>96</td><td>If the source of our failures thus far has been the inability of our bodies to contain feral souls, what if we were to reverse the process? By purging a beast of its memories and infusing it with a man's soul─one still possessed of its own memories─we stand to gain absolute control over a vessel of great power. My subordinate, who first proposed this brilliant hypothesis, shall have the honor of being the first to transcend our meager limits. I must prepare his soul for extraction at once!</td></tr>
