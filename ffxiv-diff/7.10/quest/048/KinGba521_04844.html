This revelation drives Tepeke to conclude that the Justiciar himself spurs their growth before sending them to attack hapless citizens. However, nothing is certain until you can confront the man himself, and for that you must find him. The alchemist suggests returning to Yedlihmad, where stories of the Justiciar are on everyone's lips. Perhaps somewhere within the tales you can find a hint as to his whereabouts. Tepeke departs to the settlement and asks you to help ask the locals about the Justiciar's recent feats.</td></tr>

Tepeke will doubtless be excited to hear this piece of information.→Unsurprisingly, the youth of Yedlihmad seem enamored by the Justiciar's deeds, but there are dissenting voices among the older population.

<tr><td></td><td>7</td><td>TEXT_KINGBA521_04844_SEQ_07</td><td>Returning to Tepeke, you find her attempting to converse with a merchant. Though he's reluctant to speak the truth at first, he eventually reveals himself to be the father of the Justiciar, whose real name is Virazahn. The merchant confesses that his son visited him not long ago, taking valuable alchemical materials and maps containing information on trade routes. While the man feels guilt at his son's actions, he realizes that sharing his story may be the only way to stop his son from committing further misdeeds, and agrees to report to the Radiant Host. Tepeke plans to do the same, hoping that this information will undermine Virazahn's waxing popularity. It remains to be seen whether public opinion can be swayed, but in the meantime, you should keep your ear to the ground for any rumors regarding the Justiciar.

※The next role quest will be available from Tepeke upon reaching level 96 in any magical ranged DPS class.</td></tr>
