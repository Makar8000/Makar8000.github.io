Beruru was distraught, and in a moment of poor judgment, the moogle tried to encourage her by stating she could─and should─stand on her own two feet as a pictomancer. Beruru, however, responded with anger, leading to an argument which culminated in the two parting ways. Kupopo further explains that Beruru is an exceptionally gifted pictomancer that can imbue her creations with life─and alter the living as well. He now believes that, in a fit of grief, Beruru sealed herself within the painting─the last remnant of Janquetilaque's memory─and bids you enter the world of the painting to save her.</td></tr>
