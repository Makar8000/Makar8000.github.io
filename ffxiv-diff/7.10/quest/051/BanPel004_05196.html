<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td class="add">1</td><td class="add">TEXT_BANPEL004_05196_SEQ_01</td><td class="add">Due to a shortage of guides familiar with upstream Kozama'uka, the Turali Travel Agency is struggling to make the most of its recent expansion into Earthenshire. When you posit that a certain bandit gang might make for potential recruits, Liplu balks at first, given that they kidnapped Vow Wuk Lamat herself. However, the Pelu then recalls that they not only turned themselves in, but were later released on parole. As they may be interested in making a fresh start, she requests your help in tracking them down, and suggests you begin by taking a trip to Many Fires and inquiring among the locals.

As this was clearly a traumatic experience, Liplu is keen not only to hear the full story, but to clear up the misunderstanding, and to that end she asks you to find Wawkesa and bring him back.</td></tr>

Having been forced to toil in Shaaloani mines as children for many years, Wawkesa and his comrades one day realized they would need to escape or die beneath the earth. Though they made good their escape, their foreman attempted to hunt them down, and it was only by fleeing to Kozama'uka and turning to crime that they managed to evade recapture. Hearing this, Liplu reassures Wawkesa that she does not wish to bind or send him back, and once again extends him and his crew an invitation to earn an honest living at the Turali Travel Agency. Though he is unsure how precisely they may be of service, he is willing to accept, and so all leave to discuss matters further at Dock Poga.</td></tr>

Emboldened, he and his comrades resolve to do their part and give back to the community, with Wawkesa taking charge of the brand-new eatery. When queues of hungry visitors inevitably clamor to sample the local cuisine, Liplu and company will yet again have need of their special advisor.</td></tr>
