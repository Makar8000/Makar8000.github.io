<tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>TEXT_KINGME106_04937_SEQ_01</td><td>After a quick word with Tassos, you are shown through to the Backroom, the headquarters of Oblivion. There, Cahciua, Shale, and Genolt provide you with an overview of their operations, which include investigating Preservation, an organization credited with developing interdimensional fusion─the power which brought Alexandria to Tural. In the course of the conversation, Shale recognizes Krile's earring to be a data storage device. The manner in which Krile and the accessory arrived in the Source leads to speculation that her parents may in fact be the founders of Oblivion, and she is given permission to review data in the Backroom. While your other comrades are then engaged in various ways, you find yourself roped into lending Genolt a hand. Even now, he regards you with his unsettlingly familiar grin in anticipation of your aid...
