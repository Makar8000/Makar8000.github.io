As part of a rigorous training regime, it willingly and tirelessly carries you hither and yon.</td><td>Hells, he's every bit as muscular
and majestic as I remembered!

As it was impractical to feed it the prodigious quantities of ants its kind consumes in the wild, however, it was instead raised on a diet of beaten eggs. This specimen is well accustomed to men, and permits those it trusts to ride upon its back.</td><td class="modify">→We can ill afford to place

This specimen is particularly inquisitive, and having been imbued with the ability to fly, it has further developed a taste for travel.</td><td>If the punutiys are happy,
then I'm happy too.

While it has sent countless foes plummeting into endless void, by triumphing over its maker, you appear to have gained control over it.</td><td>A well-maintained airship can mean
the difference between life and a
horrible, plummetin' death.

Thereafter, subsequent generations of rulers took to filling the cauldron with various delicacies, which they enjoyed even as they hovered in the heavens.</td><td class="modify">→What is this? It smells...spicy.
