While her investigation has turned up valid insights into the disappearance of the shooting stars, Govv dismisses her findings as a fabrication, on the basis that shorewalkers like you and Reyna possess only a superficial understanding of matters of the sea. Seeking to give Govv a taste of humility, Reyna proposes a contest to demonstrate the full depths of your angling expertise. Reel in three deep Velodyna carp before Govv does to prove that you are as capable a fisher as he.</td></tr>
