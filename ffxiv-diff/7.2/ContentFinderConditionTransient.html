<tr><td></td><td>1006</td><td>Drawing upon his ever-fertile imagination, the wandering minstrel weaves his own interpretation of events surrounding the Flood of Light, the calamity that engulfed nigh the entirety of the First. From the cause of the Flood to the outcome of the struggles that followed, the man's evocative verse conjures up vivid images in your mind's eye─images of an alternate future that may have unfolded for Ryne, the young Oracle of Light...</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>1007</td><td class="modify">The faux commander has a yen for a tale from his native Far East, which prompts you to call to mind the unbridled ferocity of Byakko, one of the Four Lords of legend. Revisit now your grueling encounter with the mighty auspice, and fight to lift the dark cloud that shrouds his heart ere you are overcome by his heavenly gales...→</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>1008</td><td>Before the dome appeared, in the northern region of what is now Heritage Found, a Tonawawtan village was terrorized by a tural vidraal. Zoraal Ja himself led the Landsguard in an effort to quell the beast's boundless fury, yet while the First Promise returned in triumph, few know what became of the village and its people. In your search for clues as to the identity of Gulool Ja's mother, you learn that Zoraal Ja visited the region many times over the years, and that it may be home to a secret research facility. And so you and yours attempt to retrace the King of Resolve's steps and unearth a buried past...</td></tr>

Wielding the soul of a terrible toad, he prefers to engage his opponents in duels of dance, using his heightened abilities to command the dance floor. If you are to claim victory, you shall need more than might and magic─indeed, you shall need a sense of rhythm.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>1020</td><td class="modify">→Once more you have shared your firsthand account of your matches with Gabbro, Solution Nine's acclaimed cartoonist, and once more you cannot help but picture the spectacles he describes.

<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>1021</td><td class="modify">→Following your triumph over Dancing Green, you now prepare to engage your next opponent, Sugar Riot. A rebellious artist who utilizes the soul of a pudding, she manifests her imaginings with an augmented palette, devastating her foes with beautiful brutality. One can only wonder, in the art of war, will the unstoppable upstart be able to keep up with this visionary?</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>1022</td><td class="modify">→Your bout against Sugar Riot exposed you to the power of her creativity unleashed. Now you wonder, if she had let her art truly run rampant, what manner of creations might she have revealed?</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>1023</td><td class="modify">→The president's “script” has culminated in a grudge match between you and the Brute Bomber, who has recklessly injected himself with multiple feral souls. Now an abomination, the only way to save the reviled heel is to stop him forcefully through battle. For his sake, this is a fight you cannot afford to lose.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>1024</td><td class="modify">→It seems the devastation wrought by the Brute Abombinator in your battle was not quite enough to satisfy Gabbro─at least not for the purposes of his cartoons.

With that which gives your lives' purpose on the line, the match between the unenhanced warrior and the Howling Blade has all of Alexandria on the edge of their seats. It is time to see once and for all who will come out on top: the lone wolf, or the undefeated upstart? </td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>1026</td><td class="modify">→Gabbro's words have sparked your imagination, inspiring you to envision your title match against the Howling Blade in new ways. Had he brought the full might of Fenrir to bear, the lone wolf's formidable strength would have reached greater heights still. How might you have fared if the battle continued to rage on...?</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1027</td><td>In the waning days of the old kingdom, the people of Alexandria sought a way to survive as their home sank beneath the earth. They built a towering structure that enveloped the royal castle itself, and as the long years came and went, Everkeep grew to soaring heights. Yet some whisper that the castle has withstood the ravages of time, and in the city's foundation endures as a symbol of bygone glory. From within those timeworn depths Calyx sends his transmissions, and you must delve into Alexandria's past to ascertain their source.</td></tr>

You stoke the memories of that battle into a fierce fire, reigniting your struggle to return the great auspice to her senses ere you succumb to her mournful melody.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1030</td><td>Calyx's trail has led you to Alexandria's castle and into a wicked trap. Seeking to take more precise measurements of your strength, Calyx pits you against a mechanical guardian forged from Sphene's memories of Zelenia, the second-in-command of the royal knights. The queen implores you to lay this affront to her dear friend's honor to rest. Make ready to test your mettle against one of Alexandria's finest blades!</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>1031</td><td>Once more the wandering minstrel weaves a tale with his musical talents, this time an ode to a stalwart knight who served with distinction beneath thunderous skies. With peerless skills and formidable magicks she defended the throne, yet as the queen was barred from the battlefield, she never spied Zelenia's cold, merciless gaze, nor glimpsed the raging fury that burned within her breast. What would this simulacrum born of the queen's memories become had Sphene possessed firsthand knowledge of the warrior's unbridled ferocity? As the ballad fills your ears, a vision of this daunting foe begins to take shape...</td></tr>
