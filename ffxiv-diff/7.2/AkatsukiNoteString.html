Its many and diverse peoples spent centuries mired in territorial wars until the epic deeds of Gulool Ja Ja and his dream of Tuliyollal saw them united under the banner of a single nation some eighty years ago.

This age of peace would endure until the unquiet days which followed the rite of succession. Scarcely had Wuk Lamat and Koana ascended the throne when the new Vows were faced with an unusual crisis─the abrupt appearance of an enormous dome of energy over Yyasulani. It was then that a mechanical army led by Zoraal Ja, the true son of the former Dawnservant, emerged from the glowing structure, and launched an assault upon the capital of Tuliyollal.

Upon investigation, the dome was found to contain a fraction of a shard world fused with the local region. The reflection's partial rejoining caused a temporal anomaly, its nature such that while mere moments had passed outside, those trapped within had lived through thirty years. During those lost decades, Queen Sphene, ruler of the dome's people, joined hands with Zoraal Ja. Together they built the kingdom of Alexandria anew, and in a bid to plunder aether from other worlds, orchestrated the invasion which brought such panic and destruction to Tural.

Although the Warrior of Light was able to aid the newly ascended Dawnservants in defeating the immediate threat, the dome itself persists─as do the issues surrounding the repatriation of those native to Yyasulani.→Comprised of two great landmasses─Xak Tural, the northern lands of the Father, and Yok Tural, the southern lands of the Mother─the continent of the “New World” lies far to the west of Eorzea's shores.

<tr><td></td><td>149</td><td>A tural vidraal is a rare example of when a creature of advanced age evolves far beyond the usual limits of its species. Meaning “land grasper” in the common tongue, the term well describes how the monstrous power of these entities comes to dominate the region in which they dwell.

The existence of several tural vidraal have been recorded to date, but even among these anomalies, the infamous Valigarmanda was unrivaled in strength. It was dubbed the “Skyruin,” a name earned for the destruction it visited upon Tural every time it stirred from slumber. Valigarmanda's reign of terror continued until eight decades past, when Gulool Ja Ja and his company of heroes subdued the beast and sealed it within the Yok Huy temple of Karryorzar the Gracious.

The Skyruin awakened one last time during the rite of succession, its prison of ice unmade by the reckless actions of Bakool Ja Ja. Fortunately for the region's inhabitants, the Mamool Ja's rival candidates and their champions rose to the challenge. Upon the field of battle did they come together to slay the scourge of Urqopacha, and write the final chapter to its legend.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>152</td><td>The Storm Surge is the name given to the great conflict that raged in the Ninth some four hundred and fifty years ago. Engulfing the Kingdom of Alexandria and other major powers of the age, it brought the entire world to the brink of destruction.

The impetus for the Storm Surge was an anomalous shift in the star's aether, which saw lightning energy grow ever more abundant. This gave rise to a tumultuous rainy season that lengthened with each passing year, causing crops and livestock alike to wither for want of sunlight. As desperation drove the people to search for a solution, a singular ore was discovered that had apparently manifested as a result of the aetheric imbalance. Later dubbed electrope, this ore had the ability to absorb and contain lightning, and by etching arcane circuits upon it─a technique derived from the knowledge of the Milalla people─it could convert the stored energy into any of the other elements. With this development, electrope became a miraculous material that found use in countless applications.

In those early days, however, electrope was a scarce resource. Seeking to secure sufficient reserves, nations fought over the precious ore, with sporadic skirmishes inevitably escalating into open war. Predictably, electrope too came to be employed on the battlefield, and in an act of madness, the nation of Lindblum deployed a doomsday weapon that devastated the star's aetheric balance, triggering a disaster the equal of any umbral calamity. So it was that the Storm Surge, which had already claimed innumerable lives, came to its conclusion, with no nation the victor. The Kingdom of Alexandria alone barely escaped annihilation, and afterwards was flooded with refugees from nearby lands.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>155</td><td>Dominating the skies above the enclosed portion of Yyasulani, this colossal twelve-level tower rises from the heart of Heritage Found.

When the balance of aether collapsed in the Ninth, only the Kingdom of Alexandria was fortunate enough to survive the calamity. Nevertheless, it suffered tremendous devastation, with great swathes of its territory submerged by endless rains.

Against this dire backdrop, a collective of scientists known as Preservation announced a plan to build a great tower over the royal palace, within which survivors might take shelter from the rising waters. It was a project of unprecedented scale, but through the extensive and innovative use of electrope, what was thought impossible became possible. Over the following centuries, additional elements were added to the structure, with sectors for primary and secondary industries constructed beside residential areas, until it grew into its present form, with all the facilities needed not only for people to survive, but to thrive.

Eventually, life within Everkeep became so advanced that the populace could enjoy indulgences like an amusement park, which was opened on the uppermost level. Later, however, when the method for recreating the departed from preserved memories was perfected, the park was renamed Living Memory and repurposed as a home for the Endless. This level alone remained in the Ninth when interdimensional fusion was employed to join Alexandria to the Source.</td></tr>
