Its design incorporates a monitor which displays comical expressions in lieu of a face, that it might be more approachable to the public.</td><td>Outrunner guide unit identified.

As dutiful as it is laid-back.</td><td>This fully grown mehwapyarra (“capybara” in certain other parts) was wandering alone in Shaaloani when it was attacked and swallowed whole by the tural vidraal Ttokrrone. Fortunately for the creature, you appeared and put down its devourer before it could be digested, and it now lends you its back out of a sense of duty.</td><td>The Fury take these
ridiculous flying rodents!

As your trusty steed, this creature can look forward to living to a ripe old age.</td><td>Found grazing the plains of Xak Tural, this stoutly built beastkin has been prized since ancient times on account of fairly every part of it being a useful resource. Owing to its importance in their lives, many nomadic tribes revere it as their guiding animal, and migrate alongside it with the seasons.</td><td>Well, you two look happier than
a pair of rroneek in the sun.

So impressed was it by your prowess, it chose to accompany you on your travels in hopes of witnessing more heroic feats.</td><td>Like our esteemed ancestor, I will
fill the skies with beauteous songs!

As the underlying creature is ordinarily mild-mannered, it is infused with the soul of a savage predator to lend it ferocity at the onset of battle.</td><td>That strikes me as a rather curious thing to be
researching, but to each their own, I suppose!
