Yet your opponents wield feral souls to augment their strength, so you in turn must use the simulacra of past warriors to balance the scales. Your debut match is against Black Cat, a fellow rookie harnessing the power of Cath Palug, and if you are to seize victory against this feline foe, you shall need to be agile indeed...</td></tr>

Intrigued by the possibilities, you begin to imagine the deadly clash anew... </td></tr>
