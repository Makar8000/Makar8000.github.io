Such a pampered life led to boredom, however, and he took to whiling away the days in mischief. Dismayed by his son's behavior, the king sent him off to squire for a renowned hero, that he might learn something of responsibility and leadership.</td><td class="modify">→By the onion, in my rambling
I forgot why I called you over!

However, he fell overboard when the vessel encountered rough seas, and drifted for days before being deposited on a desert island.
