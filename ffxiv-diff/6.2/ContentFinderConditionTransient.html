<tr><td></td><td>82</td><td>In the moons following the Calamity, myriad rumors of ghastly creatures stalking the Twelveswood began spreading across the realm like wildfire. While most of the rumors have since been deemed unfounded, there is one series of events that has remained difficult to cast off as merely the ravings of broken-minded smallfolk: that concerning the supposed Dark Rider of the Shroud. After several deaths attributed to this mysterious figure, Seedseer O-App-Pesi sought communion with the spirits of the Twelveswood, only to learn that the rider was none other than the elder primal Odin. Slain in the Third Astral Era by an Allagan hero, why and how the primal has returned to Eorzea remains a mystery─one now in the capable hands of Eorzea's adventurers.</td></tr>

As well as providing passage across the Sea of Clouds, this great stone bridge also serves to anchor the series of arcane wards known as Daniffen's Collar.

Long has the Holy See relied upon these barriers to shield the city from Dravanian assault, but it did not reckon upon the brazen actions of Lady Iceheart. The outermost layer of protection has been dispelled, allowing the mighty dragon Vishap to land upon the far end of the Steps of Faith. Leading an army of lesser kin, the massive creature is intent on destroying the exposed foundations of the remaining wards. Take up position alongside the Temple Knights, and defend the structure from the ravaging forces of the Horde!→</td></tr>

Needless to say, he was not, but he nevertheless made for a tremendous opponent. Upon hearing of how you and your comrades claimed victory atop Mt. Gulg, the minstreling wanderer was immediately driven into a fit of inspired creativity, and the result is yet another composition that will send even the most unimaginative Warrior of Darkness hurtling into the depths of memory that they might once more do battle with Eulmore's fallen tyrant.</td></tr>

Beyond the emptiness of the rift awaits a shadowed castle swarming with voidsent, and you steel yourselves for a hostile reception.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>870</td><td>Your search for the great wyrm Azdaja in the void has brought you to Zero's domain, where you hope to find information that will lead you to the mysterious Golbez. But it soon becomes apparent that your victory over Scarmiglione did not go unnoticed, for now another archfiend, the ravishing-but-cruel Barbariccia, has descended to challenge you. While there is no guarantee that she will yield the answers she teases, the only way is forward, and you sally forth to confront her in her stormy domain.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>871</td><td>The void─a world without death, where the strong devour the weak... Upon hearing your tales from that lightless place, the wandering minstrel cannot help but wonder: what if Barbariccia had devoured more of the great wyrm's aether? Having mused thus, the man then calls upon his not inconsiderable dramatic flair to weave a new verse, one which imagines a vastly empowered archfiend. The breezy melody sets your mind adrift upon shadowed winds, where you relive the stormy encounter, now stormier still...</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>872</td><td>While the identity of Pandæmonium's assailant is yet unknown, Erichthonios makes no effort to hide his doubts concerning Lahabrea, who he suspects is using the infernal prison for private experimentation. As if to confirm to the warder's suspicions, a familiar appears in the halls of Asphodelos, claiming to be none other than the chief keyward himself. The creature mocks you with cryptic warnings before vanishing, leaving naught but questions in its wake. Their answers beckon from the shadows of Abyssos, daring brave souls to seek them out.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>873</td><td>To see Nemjiji's frenzy as you recount your battle with the proto-Carbuncle, one might think that she had been infected with the mythic creation's corrupting poisons and was scrambling to record her final words before expiring. Although she claims that the many fantastical bestiaries that lie scattered about the laboratory are simply for research, you gather that she would take great pride in seeing her name inscribed upon the cover of one.</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>876</td><td>Erichthonios's mind falls into the hands of the enemy, and he is spirited away to Tartaros, Pandæmonium's deepest circle. The only path to his rescue goes through Agdistis, whose magicks are peerless among the keywards─even moreso now that they have been augmented by Hephaistos's endless experimentation. To deliver her soul from suffering and bring Erichthonios to safety, you must face your most daunting foe yet.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>877</td><td>The story of Agdistis and her demise is the stuff of legends, and Nemjiji frantically makes notes in the margins of her records as you recount your tale. However, her scrawling makes it difficult to tell whether these are embellishments or scientific musings. Either way, ere your quest is through, parchment and ink may very well become a precious resource in Claudien's workshop.</td></tr>

However, Themis and Erichthonios succeed in convincing the chief keyward to allow you a chance to prove the worth of another way. You are tasked with interring Hegemone, the keyward of Abyssos and a master of creation magicks in her own right. Succeed in this, and you may continue your journey into the facility's deeper circles. Fail, and Pandæmonium─along with its warders and creations─shall be reduced to nothing.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>881</td><td>You could have sworn that Nemjiji began writing ere you opened your mouth to speak of your battle with Hegemone but pass it off as a unique quirk of the researcher's method of recording dictation. A perusal of her writings afterwards proves to be an exhilarating read, but you wonder whether your account of events was quite so animated...</td></tr>

You hurry to the hidden experimental compound, that this chain of twisted ambition might be broken at last.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>884</td><td>As your journey into the depths of Pandæmonium concludes, you are left with nearly more questions than answers. Professor Claudien has disappeared, and Pandæmonium has drifted into the modern age upon the currents of the aetherial sea. Even so, the glint in Nemjiji's eyes shines brighter than ever, and she seems more than eager to provide her own answers as she hears your story. Whether those will give rise to ever more questions, however, remains to be seen...</td></tr>
