For a time afterwards, the site in Thanalan lay abandoned, but now it has been revived as a training ground for adventurers. On tracks of steel the goblin-made ceruleum engines arrive, laden with supplies that combatants should seize if they hope to claim victory.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086039.tex</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td></tr>

By taking control of the loading stations, teams can claim the supplies delivered by the ceruleum engines.

■Ceruleum Engines in Motion
If you come into contact with a ceruleum engine while it is moving, you will incur potentially lethal damage.
A warning will sound to indicate the approach of a ceruleum engine.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086040.tex</td><td>■Loading Stations
Ceruleum engines deliver supplies to loading stations. Players cannot enter a loading station while riding machina. Each team may occupy or control a loading station.

■Occupying a Loading Station
When a ceruleum engine arrives at a station, standing in the area next to the engine will cause a gauge to fill. Once it is full, your team will occupy that station. The gauge fills more quickly when you have a higher number of team members near the engine than the opponent. The greater the difference in players, the quicker the gauge fills. However, only the first four players from each team are counted. Those standing near the engine will also gain the Sheer Will status, which greatly increases damage dealt. Making use of this status will help to reduce the number of enemies and occupy the station more quickly.

■Controlling a Loading Station
Once a loading station has been occupied, a new gauge will appear indicating your control over the station. When filled, the station will be under your team's control, allowing you to claim its supplies. This gauge will only fill when your team has a number of members equal to or higher than the opponent in that area.
When the supplies have been claimed, the ceruleum engine will leave the station and the gauges will be reset.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086041.tex</td><td class="modify">■Supplies
There are four types of supplies. For the first half of the match, the ceruleum engine will deliver main ceruleum tanks, gobbiejuice, and gobtank keys at random. In the second half of the match, they will only deliver gobcrates.
Each type grants its own benefits and increases the Soaring stacks of the whole team.

Main Ceruleum Tanks
Each party on the team gains 50 ceruleum.

Gobbiejuice
Fills the adrenaline gauge of every team member.

Gobtanks
Two gobtanks will appear at the core and will travel down the north and south routes to the enemy base. They are considerably more powerful than regular mammets and can deal severe damage to towers and the core.

If the damage your team deals to a goblin mercenary surpasses that of the opposing team by a certain amount, it will join your side. If the mercenary's HP reaches zero before this condition has been fulfilled, it will form an alliance with whichever team dealt the most damage to it.

■Mercenary Deployment
Once you have formed an alliance with a mercenary, it will appear at your team's core and will attempt to destroy the enemy's towers and core, much like a mammet would. Forming an alliance with a mercenary that appeared from the north mercenary base will cause it to travel along the northern route, with the same being true of the south mercenary base and southern route.
Mercenaries are also governed by the Contractual Obligation status, and they will leave the field of battle once the status counts down to zero. After a certain amount of time passes, they will reappear from their respective base and will no longer be allied with either team.</td><td>ui/icon/086000/086044.tex</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td></tr>

Each player will rate in one of six tiers─Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, or Crystal. Once they have attained a particular tier, a player will never drop down to a lower tier during that season.

The sub-levels within each tier are called “risers.” The number of risers varies per tier, with three risers each for Bronze and Silver, four for Gold and Platinum, and five within the Diamond tier. Unlike tiers, it is possible to drop down to a lower riser.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;■Rising Stars■&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
When you win a ranked match, you will gain one Rising Star. Similarly, a loss will remove one Star. Once you have earned the maximum three Rising Stars in one riser, an additional win will allow you to move up a riser. Winning three matches in a row will apply a streak bonus, netting you two Rising Stars per win.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;■The Crystal Tier■&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
Once you have reached Crystal, the highest tier, victory and defeat will be reflected by your Crystal Credit, rather than Rising Stars. The amount of Credit you earn or forfeit in matches is determined by the difference in average Credit between your team and the opposing team. Streak bonuses do not apply to Crystal Credit.

To win, one team must move the tactical crystal from the center of the field to the goal point. If neither team accomplishes this during the time limit, the match will proceed into overtime.

During overtime, the victory conditions differ depending on both teams' progress. “Progress” indicates the maximum progress a team has made in bringing the tactical crystal toward their goal at any point during the match─as opposed to its current position relative to either goal─and thus will never decrease even should the crystal be reclaimed by the opposing team. Progress is displayed on the HUD throughout the match.

・Should your team have the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime, you must keep the entire opposing team out of the ring around the tactical crystal for three seconds to win.

・Should the opposing team have the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime, you must beat their progress score during overtime to win.

Renovation is performed by a talented team of mammets and will be completed after a predetermined period of time. Finalize renovation by accessing the logboard in front of your upgraded structure after the mammets have finished their work.

You may check the logboard during renovation to confirm current progress and estimated time of completion. You may also continue using workshops and granaries as usual, even while they are being renovated.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1040</td></tr>

A plot's level of moisture has the following four stages:
 &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Soaked,” “Wet,” “Moist,” and “Dry.”

A plot will be soaked immediately after being watered, and its moisture level will gradually decrease until it has become dry.

・Soaked:
The maximum level of moisture.
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;A plot cannot be watered at this stage.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
Active for approximately six hours after watering a plot.

・Wet
A moderate level of moisture.
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Plots may be watered at this stage.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
Active between approximately six to twenty-four hours after watering a plot.

・Moist:
The lowest level of moisture.
Active between approximately twenty-four to thirty-six hours after watering a plot.

・Dry:
The level at which a plot is bereft of moisture.
Active approximately thirty-six hours after watering a plot.
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Crops will be unable to grow on plots that have reached this stage.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

To begin, enable Feed mode from the islekeep's index, then approach an animal in the pasture equipped with the feed item of your choice to give it the tasty treat it deserves.

Feeding an animal will improve its mood and sate its appetite.

■Feed
There are three different types of animal feed available:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed, and premium island greenfeed.

Each feed can be crafted via the Sanctuary Crafting Log, and both types of greenfeed require produce yielded from the cropland.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Hostile,” “Unhappy,” “Content,” “Chipper,” and “Gleeful.”&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

・Island Sweetfeed
Improves an animal's mood by &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;one level.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; Can improve the mood up to &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;content&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;.

・Island Greenfeed
Improves an animal's mood by &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;two levels.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; Can improve the mood up to &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;chipper&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;.

The production of handicrafts requires materials that can be gathered from the wilds of your island, the crops you grow, or the animals you keep.

・Time
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;The time it takes to create a given item is displayed in hours.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; In order to produce a given handicraft, a sufficient block of time must be available in the workshop's agenda.

Groove is reset at the beginning of each season.

The more popular an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Popularity may change at the beginning of a new season, but it will remain constant throughout that season.

・Supply
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Items will be in one of the following fives stages of supply: Nonexistent, Insufficient, Sufficient, Surplus, and Overflowing.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

The less abundant an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Furthermore, the popularity of handicrafts may change each cycle according to both commercial trends in Limsa Lominsa and the type/amount of items you sell from your island.

You can check predicted shifts in market behavior by referencing the “Demand Shift” column of the Supply &amp; Demand interface.

If you produce too much of the same product, the market will be inundated with it, causing supply to become “Overflowing.” Pay special attention to changes in the market when looking to create a large amount of a single kind of handicraft.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1065</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>74.9</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>Tricks of the Trade</td><td></td><td>Mastering the intricacies of isleworks production and trade begins with a close examination of the materials available to you and the strategic implementation of efficiency bonuses.

For those islekeeps who feel like they have a firm grasp on the basics, the following tips will help you take your island industry─and earnings─to the next level.


■Popular Items Sell Even Better When Scarce
When a handicraft has High or Very High popularity, the inclination may be to produce large quantities of it, as popularity increases selling price. However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.

By waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.

Demand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.


■Start the Season Short and Efficient
Levels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.

To quickly activate efficiency bonsues, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Strategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1074</td></tr>

As an example, let's try scheduling the production of an isleworks potion.

■Press Plus to Schedule
The plus button on the Isleworks Agenda screen indicates an opening in your schedule. Select this button to get started.</td><td></td><td>■Choose Your Handicraft
After pressing the plus button, a menu of all handicrafts currently available for production will open. In keeping with our example, select “Isleworks Potion” from the list. You will notice that the materials required to create a given handicraft are displayed on this screen, but you can still schedule an item even if you don't have all the materials just yet.

Use the Schedule button to set your agenda!</td><td></td><td>■Export Your Items and Reap Your Rewards!
Now that you have set an agenda, your faithful team of crafty mammets will create and export all the handicrafts you ordered while you bask in the sunshine and imbibe refreshing liquids.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;An isleworks potion takes four hours (Earth time) to produce.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; Remember: those who would judge a mammet for the time it takes to produce a handicraft are not worthy of that goodly mammet.

After the designated time has passed, put down your beverage long enough to speak with the tactful taskmaster once more, and your pockets will be filled with the earnings from your most recent export!

■Managing Materials
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Materials used for the creation of a handicraft will be depleted at the start of production.

If you do not possess the required materials by the time production is scheduled to begin, your mammets will be unable to create the handicraft you ordered.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; They might even cry due to feelings of inadequacy.

So, if you did not have enough island palm leaves or islewort when you scheduled the isleworks potion, be sure to gather two of each by the time production is scheduled to start. Don't be the Warrior of Light who made a mammet cry.

You can keep track of what materials will be expended during current or upcoming production by clicking the Review Materials button.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1071</td></tr>

For example, an isleworks potion and isleworks firesand are both classified as “Concoctions.” By scheduling production of isleworks firesand right after your isleworks potion, you will activate an efficiency bonus that creates two pinches of isleworks firesand with the same time and materials it would normally take to make one!

But you don't have to keep track of all your bonuses in that steel-trap mind of yours─the text “Efficiency Bonus!” will appear on the agenda for items that will be produced twice as a result of your clever scheduling.</td><td></td><td>But wait! There's more.

What if you scheduled an isleworks potion, followed by a pinch of isleworks firesand, followed by &lt;Emphasis&gt;another&lt;/Emphasis&gt; isleworks potion?

Thanks to efficiency bonuses, what might have been only three handicrafts has now been expanded to five! Think of the profits! Keep in mind both the type and order of handicrafts you add to your agenda, and you will be swimming in an abundance of seafarer's cowries in no time.

■Limitations of the Efficiency Bonus
Unfortunately, due to the peculiarities of the mammet's psyche, your tiny workers will not be nearly as excited making the same item twice in a row. While an isleworks potion/isleworks firesand combination will earn you an efficiency bonus, an order of isleworks potion/isleworks potion will get you nothing but some blinking and basic adherence to general protocol.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;In other words, only different items belonging to the same category can activate efficiency bonuses.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

When aiming for bonuses, be sure you are scheduling different handicrafts. Variety, after all, is the spice of island life.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1075</td></tr>
