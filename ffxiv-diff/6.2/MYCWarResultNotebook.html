<tr><td></td><td>30</td><td>23</td><td>...</td><td>Rostik Liubasch</td><td>Race: Hrothgar
Age: 56
Birthplace: Bozja

A key figure of the Bozjan Resistance, Rostik fights to free his country from the tyrannical clutches of the Empire.

He is the son of an elite gunbreaker who served Bozja in its days of independence, and there can be little doubt that the path he has walked has been in the footsteps of this great man─a man of whom Rostik himself remembers scarcely a thing.

In those days, the Garlean Empire marched mercilessly and inexorably on the scattered small countries in the southern reaches of Ilsabard. Fearing for his son's safety, Rostik's father entrusted the child to his elderly master before departing for the front lines, from which he would never return.

Though hailed as a hero by his people, the man's bravery was ultimately in vain, and once-proud Bozja fell under the imperial yoke. The young Rostik vowed that he would one day be strong enough to defend his beloved homeland, and devoted himself to training as a gunbreaker under the selfsame master who once taught his father, eventually being conscripted by the imperial army. &lt;Emphasis&gt;I will be my nation's shield&lt;/Emphasis&gt;─or so he swore to himself. Yet Rostik was doomed to suffer a fate as tragic as his father's─if not more so. While he was serving the Empire, the Bozja incident occurred, and his beloved homeland was razed to nothingness.

After the fall of the citadel, Rostik awaited his chance and fled the army. For a time, he fought like a beast thirsting for vengeance, launching reckless strikes against imperial forces from seemingly every direction. Yet there was a limit to what one gunbreaker─no matter how skilled─could do against an entire army. One day, Rostik was ambushed by an imperial regiment, and suffering grave wounds, was left to die alone deep in the forest.

In a turn of good fortune, before succumbing to his wounds, he was discovered by Bajsaljen, who had seen the gunbreaker fall in battle against their common foe, and took him in, tending to his injuries. Persuaded by the cerebral Resistance leader to abandon his rage-driven quest for revenge, Rostik now fights to protect his countrymen, imparting his impressive skills to a new generation of gunbreakers as a mentor to his subordinates.

So it is that the art of the gunbreaker, once in danger of extinction, came to be preserved through the years. Indeed, the high-ranking Resistance officer Marsak and Thancred, the “Scion” who he met through a curious twist of fate, are among Rostik's countless pupils. Rostik continues his fight to this day, that he might see his techniques handed down to posterity, and his nation one day reborn.</td></tr>
<tr class="modify"><td class="modify">→</td><td>31</td><td>31</td><td>...</td><td>Atori Moribe</td><td class="modify">Race: Au Ra
Age: 29
Birthplace: Dagluk, Southern Nagxia

Though born and raised in the southern reaches of Nagxia, her lineage can be traced back to Doma. Indeed, for several generations her family thrived in Nagxia making the land's culture their own, all the while dutifully upholding their Doman traditions. Unfortunately, her family line was cut woefully short twenty-six years prior, and Atori must now uphold these traditions on her own.

Under the command of the XIth Legion, the XVIIth infantry division was dispatched to invade the mountainous regions of southern Nagxia. While the Nagxian resistance lacked a comparable martial force, they were not without cunning. Rather than attack directly, they relied on their knowledge of the land, assailing the imperials via surprise raids and ambushes. The Nagxian resistance was relentless, stalking the imperials both by the light of day and in the dead of night. Thus the XVIIth infantry was deprived of rest, kept constantly on edge, and before long it was clear these tactics had taken their toll. Even so, no one could have foreseen what would befall the village of Dagluk.

It was a small village, and without the immediate aid of the resistance, the people found little recourse but to submit to the imperials' authority, offering up what little food and water they could afford to forestall uncertain death. Their uneasy peace would be broken, however, when an ale-sodden imperial soldier thought to assault a hapless villager. They tried to defend themself, but the drunken soldier escalated the altercation, and before long the villager was dead. When questioned by his superiors, the soldier claimed he was assaulted by the resistance, but the villagers knew the truth. Torches and tools in hand, they demanded the imperials leave Dagluk. But their cries of anger were answered only with gunfire.

The massacre of Dagluk's people was initially reported as the result of a bloody battle with the Nagxian resistance. But survivors from the village would give the lie to these claims, the dark truth made painfully clear when a soldier of the XVIIth infantry at last came forward, unable to bear the weight of his conscience. The unit was then recalled to the imperial capital where it was summarily dissolved. Emperor Varis was quick to denounce the infantry's actions, but the seeds of resentment had already been sown in Nagxia's bloodied soil.

Atori was but an innocent child of four summers when this atrocity came to pass, whisked away to safety by her mother. Though she did not emerge from the village unscathed, Atori's mother refused to stop until she was certain of their safety. And so they traveled without food or water for three days and nights, desperate to find sanctuary. Eventually they would find it in the arms of resistance soldiers out on patrol. It was only then she allowed herself to succumb to her injuries, her final breath a sigh of relief, comforted by the thought that Atori would live.

It was believed the trauma of her loss shocked Atori into silence. In time, she would find her voice again, and attest to the horrors visited upon her village.

Thanks to her mother's sacrifice, Atori had gained a new family among the resistance, none offering her comfort moreso than Kosyu, who she would come to look up to as a brother.

When she was of age she joined the resistance, taking up the lance, and with Kosyu's help she quickly became one of their more accomplished fighters in the battle for freedom.→Race: Au Ra

<tr><td></td><td>32</td><td>32</td><td>...</td><td>Kosyu</td><td>Race: Roegadyn
Age: 38
Birthplace: Bunlai, Northern Nagxia

Raised in a remote village in northern Nagxia, this capable warrior of the Nagxian resistance is one of the few Roegadyn native to the region. His true name is difficult to pronounce for those not of his clan, so his comrades in the resistance have given him the nickname “Kosyu,” which means “tiger whiskers” in the more commonly used local dialect.

His thick accent paired with his habit of mumbling means he is often misunderstood, and as a result, he does not make friends easily. However, his skill with an axe is without question, and the decision to send him to the Bozjan front line was met with unanimous approval. 

His experiences with the Empire began when the invasion of Nagxia reached Bunlai, his home. Kosyu was only eight years old when most of his kin were killed, and together with the other survivors, he fled the village and became a refugee. As the imperials advanced, they were forced farther and farther southward, and they were met with many hardships on their journey. Kosyu's younger sister by three summers was claimed by sickness, and he had no choice but to bury her himself. He swore on her grave that he would never shed another tear, and from that day forth, devoted himself to the resistance. 

Although he initially struggled to fit in due to his manner of speaking, it quickly became apparent to those around him that he not only excelled in the martial arts but also had an aptitude for academic pursuits. 

His life would take another dramatic turn one year before Nagxia finally lost its war with the Empire. Kosyu was patrolling the jungle when he encountered a mother and daughter, emaciated from hunger and exhaustion. The woman used her dying breaths to speak of the tragedy that had befallen the village of Dagluk. Traumatized by the passing of her mother and the barbaric scenes she had witnessed, the young girl could not utter a single word. Her name was Atori, though it would be some time before Kosyu would learn this. She bore a strange resemblance to his deceased sister, and he soon found himself caring for her as though she were his own flesh and blood.

Eventually, the pair grew to become two of the Nagxian resistance's most valued warriors, and they fought bravely in the battle for Castrum Viride, their achievements earning the acclaim of their comrades.

When the Eastern alliance was asked to send reinforcements to aid the Bozjan Resistance, Kosyu and Atori were quick to volunteer, and their requests were immediately accepted. Their devotion to liberating others from imperial oppression knows no bounds, and whether it be fighting for their home or for allies in distant lands, they will fight until the last.</td></tr>
