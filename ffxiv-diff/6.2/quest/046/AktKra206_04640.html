Conjuring phantom visions, he tells of his discovery of her experiments and journey into Pandæmonium to stop them. It is a story of betrayal and forlorn love, which resulted in Lahabrea and Athena bonding souls, and the former becoming corrupted by the latter's unquenchable thirst for knowledge. To save himself, Lahabrea was forced to cut away a part of his soul and seal it within a crystal. Yet even this was a part of Athena's scheme, as the crystal was used to imbue a vessel with life, creating Hephaistos.</td></tr>

When the topic of conversation turns to crystals, Themis remarks that the aether contained in the crystal you first showed him bore no resemblance to Hephaistos's, and wonders who might have sent it─a mystery of great interest to all present.

Moments after, Fourchenault Leveilleur arrives as well, evidently drawn by the marked fluctuation in energy. Upon hearing your story, he deftly maps out a tentative course of action. Ishgard will be asked to aid in a search for Claudien, and the brightest minds in aetherial research will be gathered to keep track of changes in the aetherial sea. For the time being, he asks you to stand by to assist them when the next step is decided.
