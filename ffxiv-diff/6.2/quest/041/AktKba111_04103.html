Per the Elder Seedseer's earlier instruction, however, all are to remain within the safety of the camp until the threat has passed. Nevertheless, the people are adamant that they be allowed to cross the border, and the Wood Wailers are but few, and so the Elder Seedseer goes to resolve the situation before it comes to a head.</td></tr>
