Friction is initially evident between opposing factions of the clergy, but thanks to your companions' sage mediation and guidance, they are able to find common ground. In renewing their commitment to their shared faith in Halone and acknowledging the mistakes of the past, the church shall take its first step towards reform, that it might again serve as a beacon of hope for the people.

※In the event that you leave the strategy room, you may re-enter by speaking with the Temple Knight guard at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly.</td></tr>
