But ere you are able to set off for Sharlayan to make the necessary arrangements, four mysterious beings appear who claim to be of the Twelve, the guardian deities of Eorzean myth. They declare that, in Hydaelyn's absence, they are the rightful rulers of the star, and you must prove your strength if mankind is to remain the master of his own destiny. After the gods take their leave, G'raha Tia expresses his uncertainty over the unexpected developments, but concedes that they may have far-reaching implications. So it is that you resolve to answer the gods' challenge, and formally accept the request to investigate the phantom realm.</td></tr>

Soon you come face-to-face with the Builder, and after a furious struggle, succeed in bringing him to his knees. Yet your trials are far from over, for the deity bids you press on. And you do so, going on to encounter yet more divinities in the form of Rhalgr, Azeyma, and finally Nald'thal. Each provides you with stern contest, but you succeed in prevailing over them all. Your trials appearing to be at an end for now, you and Deryk make your way back to the Omphalos.</td></tr>
