Alas, the knights of Ishgard are in no position to dispatch forces to the Keeper of the Lake at present, and so Ser Aymeric would have you investigate the wreckage on their behalf and ascertain the veracity of the astrologians' claims. Before proceeding to the Keeper of the Lake, however, Minfilia advises you to speak with a Doman watch who has been stationed on the northern shore.</td></tr>
