Before you can rise to his defense, Yda appears as if from nowhere and subdues the heretics with a flurry of blows. The battle for Snowcloak has begun, and for a moment, Alphinaud is concerned─until the fortuitous discovery of a promising tunnel serves to brighten his spirits. Alas, the tunnel is rather narrow, and will not accommodate more than a handful of troops at a time. Given that additional numbers may prove more a hindrance than a help, it is decided that the task of charting the tunnel should be entrusted to a small and highly mobile party of seasoned adventurers. Speak with the stalwart Temple Knight to learn the location of the tunnel's entrance.</td></tr>
