<tr><td></td><td>157</td><td>■Loading Stations
Ceruleum engines deliver supplies to loading stations. Players cannot enter a loading station while riding machina. Each team may occupy or control a loading station.

■Occupying a Loading Station
When a ceruleum engine arrives at a station, standing in the area next to the engine will cause a gauge to fill. Once it is full, your team will occupy that station. The gauge fills more quickly when you have a higher number of team members near the engine than the opponent. The greater the difference in players, the quicker the gauge fills. However, only the first four players from each team are counted. Those standing near the engine will also gain the Sheer Will status, which greatly increases damage dealt. Making use of this status will help to reduce the number of enemies and occupy the station more quickly.

■Controlling a Loading Station
Once a loading station has been occupied, a new gauge will appear indicating your control over the station. When filled, the station will be under your team's control, allowing you to claim its supplies. This gauge will only fill when your team has a number of members equal to or higher than the opponent in that area.
When the supplies have been claimed, the ceruleum engine will leave the station and the gauges will be reset.</td></tr>

There are four types of supplies. For the first half of the match, the ceruleum engine will deliver main ceruleum tanks, gobbiejuice, and gobtank keys at random. In the second half of the match, they will only deliver gobcrates.

■Moisture Level
A plot's level of moisture has the following four stages:
 &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Soaked,” “Wet,” “Moist,” and “Dry.”

A plot will be soaked immediately after being watered, and its moisture level will gradually decrease until it has become dry.

・Soaked:
The maximum level of moisture.
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;A plot cannot be watered at this stage.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
Active for approximately six hours after watering a plot.

・Wet
A moderate level of moisture.
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Plots may be watered at this stage.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
Active between approximately six to twenty-four hours after watering a plot.

・Moist:
The lowest level of moisture.
Active between approximately twenty-four to thirty-six hours after watering a plot.

・Dry:
The level at which a plot is bereft of moisture.
Active approximately thirty-six hours after watering a plot.
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Crops will be unable to grow on plots that have reached this stage.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

To begin, enable Gather mode from the islekeep's index. While the mode is active, select a fully grown crop to harvest its yield. With the plot now empty, you may plant seeds into it once again.

Crops require sufficient time and water to grow, and have four stages of development:

■Entrusting Your Crops
From the Cropland Management menu, choose the plot you wish the gardener to maintain, and select the “Entrust to Gardener” subcommand.

If seeds have already been planted in the plot you select, the same type of seed will automatically be applied for further cultivation. If the plot you select is currently empty, choose which seeds you wish to cultivate.

A daily fee of seafarer's cowries will be required to maintain your crops. Maintenance will be suspended if seafarer's cowries are insufficient, your supply of seeds has been exhausted, or if yields have accumulated to the maximum of 50. Plots will be marked “Under Care” if maintenance is proceeding smoothly and “Care Halted” if maintenance has been suspended.

The fee of seafarer's cowries will be automatically collected each day at &lt;ResetTime&gt;12&lt;/ResetTime&gt;&lt;If(TopLevelParameter(218))&gt;&lt;Switch(TopLevelParameter(218))&gt;&lt;Case(1)&gt;1&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(2)&gt;2&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(3)&gt;3&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(4)&gt;4&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(5)&gt;5&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(6)&gt;6&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(7)&gt;7&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(8)&gt;8&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(9)&gt;9&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(10)&gt;10&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(11)&gt;11&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(12)&gt;12&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(13)&gt;1&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(14)&gt;2&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(15)&gt;3&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(16)&gt;4&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(17)&gt;5&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(18)&gt;6&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(19)&gt;7&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(20)&gt;8&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(21)&gt;9&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(22)&gt;10&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(23)&gt;11&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;/Switch&gt;&lt;Else/&gt;12&lt;/If&gt; &lt;If(GreaterThanOrEqualTo(TopLevelParameter(218),12))&gt;p.m.&lt;Else/&gt;a.m.&lt;/If&gt; (Earth time) for all plots marked “Under Care.”

The care for plots marked “Care Halted” will resume automatically once the required conditions for maintenance have been achieved, and collection of the daily fee will resume accordingly.

■Ending Gardening Services
From the Cropland Management menu, select the plot you wish to exempt from gardening services, and choose either the “Dismiss Gardener” or “Collect Yield &amp; End Gardening Services” subcommand.

■Collecting Yields
Gardening mammets will harvest your crops for you, but these yields will not be added to your isleventory until you collect them.

From the Cropland Management menu, use either the “Collect Yield &amp; Resume Gardening Services” and “Collect Yield &amp; End Gardening Services” subcommand to collect your crops, and continue or quit gardening services, respectively.</td></tr>

To begin, enable Feed mode from the islekeep's index, then approach an animal in the pasture equipped with the feed item of your choice to give it the tasty treat it deserves.

Feeding an animal will improve its mood and sate its appetite.

■Feed
There are three different types of animal feed available:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed, and premium island greenfeed.

Each feed can be crafted via the Sanctuary Crafting Log, and both types of greenfeed require produce yielded from the cropland.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;“Hostile,” “Unhappy,” “Content,” “Chipper,” and “Gleeful.”&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

・Island Sweetfeed
Improves an animal's mood by &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;one level.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; Can improve the mood up to &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;content&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;.

・Island Greenfeed
Improves an animal's mood by &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;two levels.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; Can improve the mood up to &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;chipper&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;.

・Premium Island Greenfeed
Improves an animal's mood by &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;two levels.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; Can improve the mood up to &lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;gleeful&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;.

Animals will be marked “Under Care” if maintenance is proceeding smoothly and “Care Halted” if maintenance has been suspended.

The fee of seafarer's cowries will be automatically collected each day at &lt;ResetTime&gt;12&lt;/ResetTime&gt;&lt;If(TopLevelParameter(218))&gt;&lt;Switch(TopLevelParameter(218))&gt;&lt;Case(1)&gt;1&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(2)&gt;2&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(3)&gt;3&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(4)&gt;4&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(5)&gt;5&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(6)&gt;6&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(7)&gt;7&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(8)&gt;8&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(9)&gt;9&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(10)&gt;10&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(11)&gt;11&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(12)&gt;12&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(13)&gt;1&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(14)&gt;2&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(15)&gt;3&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(16)&gt;4&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(17)&gt;5&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(18)&gt;6&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(19)&gt;7&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(20)&gt;8&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(21)&gt;9&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(22)&gt;10&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;Case(23)&gt;11&lt;/Case&gt;&lt;/Switch&gt;&lt;Else/&gt;12&lt;/If&gt; &lt;If(GreaterThanOrEqualTo(TopLevelParameter(218),12))&gt;p.m.&lt;Else/&gt;a.m.&lt;/If&gt; (Earth time) for all animals marked “Under Care.”

The care for animals marked “Care Halted” will resume automatically once the required conditions for maintenance have been achieved, and collection of the daily fee will resume accordingly.

■Ending Caretaking Services
From the Pasture Management menu, select the animal you wish to exempt from caretaking services, and choose either the “Dismiss Caretaker” or “Collect Leavings &amp; End Caretaking Services” subcommand.

■Collecting Leavings
Caretaking mammets will gather animal products for you, but these leavings will not be added to your isleventory until you collect them.

From the Pasture Management menu, use either the “Collect Leavings &amp; Resume Caretaking Services” and “Collect Leavings &amp; End Caretaking Services” subcommand to collect the materials produced by your animals, and continue or quit caretaking services, respectively.</td></tr>

The production of handicrafts requires materials that can be gathered from the wilds of your island, the crops you grow, or the animals you keep.

・Time
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;The time it takes to create a given item is displayed in hours.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; In order to produce a given handicraft, a sufficient block of time must be available in the workshop's agenda.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;The selling price of each handicraft is displayed in seafarer's cowries.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt; As your workshop's level increases, so too will the value of the items it produces.

・Category
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Every isleworks handicraft falls under a certain category, which in turn affects efficiency bonuses.

■Managing Materials
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Materials used for the creation of a handicraft will be depleted at the start of production.

So, if you did not have enough island palm leaves or islewort when you scheduled the isleworks potion, be sure to gather two of each by the time production is scheduled to start. Don't be the Warrior of Light who made a mammet cry.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Items will be in one of the following four states of popularity: Very High, High, Average, and Low.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

The more popular an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Popularity may change at the beginning of a new season, but it will remain constant throughout that season.

・Supply
&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Items will be in one of the following fives stages of supply: Nonexistent, Insufficient, Sufficient, Surplus, and Overflowing.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

The less abundant an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Furthermore, the popularity of handicrafts may change each cycle according to both commercial trends in Limsa Lominsa and the type/amount of items you sell from your island.

You can check predicted shifts in market behavior by referencing the “Demand Shift” column of the Supply &amp; Demand interface.

If you produce too much of the same product, the market will be inundated with it, causing supply to become “Overflowing.” Pay special attention to changes in the market when looking to create a large amount of a single kind of handicraft.</td></tr>

For those islekeeps who feel like they have a firm grasp on the basics, the following tips will help you take your island industry─and earnings─to the next level.


■Popular Items Sell Even Better When Scarce
When a handicraft has High or Very High popularity, the inclination may be to produce large quantities of it, as popularity increases selling price. However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.

By waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.

Demand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.


■Start the Season Short and Efficient
Levels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.

To quickly activate efficiency bonsues, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Strategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;</td></tr>

<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>789</td><td>With an agenda in hand and a team of eager mammets at your disposal, you are free to make any and all handicrafts your heart desires. However, a very special bonus awaits those who choose their schedules cleverly.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;The efficiency bonus will double the production of a given handicraft without requiring additional materials or production time.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

Doubling the production of a handicraft means you will have two handicrafts to export, and basic mathematics tells us that two handicrafts will sell for twice as much as one handicraft will. So what are you waiting for? Activate those efficiency bonuses by following the steps below!

■Activating Efficiency Bonuses
All handicrafts belong to at least one item category, such as “Concoctions” or “Confections.”

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;Efficiency bonuses are activated by scheduling the production of similarly categorized items in direct succession.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

For example, an isleworks potion and isleworks firesand are both classified as “Concoctions.” By scheduling production of isleworks firesand right after your isleworks potion, you will activate an efficiency bonus that creates two pinches of isleworks firesand with the same time and materials it would normally take to make one!

But you don't have to keep track of all your bonuses in that steel-trap mind of yours─the text “Efficiency Bonus!” will appear on the agenda for items that will be produced twice as a result of your clever scheduling.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>790</td><td>But wait! There's more.

What if you scheduled an isleworks potion, followed by a pinch of isleworks firesand, followed by &lt;Emphasis&gt;another&lt;/Emphasis&gt; isleworks potion?

Thanks to efficiency bonuses, what might have been only three handicrafts has now been expanded to five! Think of the profits! Keep in mind both the type and order of handicrafts you add to your agenda, and you will be swimming in an abundance of seafarer's cowries in no time.

■Limitations of the Efficiency Bonus
Unfortunately, due to the peculiarities of the mammet's psyche, your tiny workers will not be nearly as excited making the same item twice in a row. While an isleworks potion/isleworks firesand combination will earn you an efficiency bonus, an order of isleworks potion/isleworks potion will get you nothing but some blinking and basic adherence to general protocol.

&lt;UIForeground&gt;F201FA&lt;/UIForeground&gt;&lt;UIGlow&gt;F201FB&lt;/UIGlow&gt;In other words, only different items belonging to the same category can activate efficiency bonuses.&lt;UIGlow&gt;01&lt;/UIGlow&gt;&lt;UIForeground&gt;01&lt;/UIForeground&gt;

When aiming for bonuses, be sure you are scheduling different handicrafts. Variety, after all, is the spice of island life.</td></tr>
<tr class="add"><td>+++</td><td>791</td><td>Now that you have taken your first steps down the path to profits, you may be curious as to how to increase your earnings even further than what a simple efficiency bonus might afford.

When you feel ready to take the plunge into the intricacies of the handicraft trade, access the Guide in your islekeep's index and check the section titled “The Workshop.”

But for now, perhaps continue enjoying that refreshing beverage─you've earned it!</td></tr>
