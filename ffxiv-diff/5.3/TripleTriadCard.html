It was long believed he had a hand in the accident that laid waste to Bozja Citadel, but this was no more than a figment of Cid Garlond's imagination─a means to cope with the truth of his traumatic past.</td></tr>

They are sticklers for tradition, the most peculiar of which is perhaps their use of helmets, for only family members are permitted to see one another without them.</td></tr>

An experiment gone awry, however, resulted in the flames of a fae lantern gaining sentience. Realizing that such a creature would be far better suited to protecting their domain, further research was conducted, leading to the creation of Lugus.</td></tr>
